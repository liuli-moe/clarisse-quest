# You are not a monster

\[1] Try to find food for the kitty

*No, no, it was an honest mistake.*

Ryouko walks on, saying nothing to you.

*It could have happened to anyone.*

Ryouko does not respond.

*It's like you said. She was, in fact, going for your face. With claws.*

Ryouko does not respond.

*Stop being so hard on yourself! Or — wait. You know what? The fact that you go so hard on yourself over something like this is why you should feel better and stop being so hard on yourself. You are not a monster.*

Ryouko sheds a small tear.

. . . . .

\*No, I don't even think it's monstrous to think that. It's just in passing, firstly, and second, at some level, you just didn't want it to have been in vain. That goes beyond just thrift; it's the respect of the hunter. It is an impulse as old as humanity itself. Older, even. Ancient. Noble.

Right, so, I'm just going to stick to looking at flowers, \*responds Ryouko. *But no bees, please.*

\*\*\[7] Resume after a minimum of distraction

You are on the edge of downtown Mitakihara. There is a lovely greenway. There is a bus stop at the road where the greenway passes the school. There is a regional map at the bus stop. You inspect the map with Ryouko.

- There is a downtown core!
- There is a Capitalism district! This isn't your priority, though.
- There is a hospital. This isn't quite the priority either.
- And there is a public library! It's over towards the high school. It should be about a ten minute walk, maybe fifteen at normal person speed.

After a close call, Ryouko learns how to operate a crosswalk signed with external lamps. She wasn't in any real danger of death, thanks to reflexes, but the poor driver must have been quite worried…

. . . . .

You get to the library about 8:30am, only to find out from a sign on the door that it's open 10am-6pm Tuesday to Friday, 10am-4pm Saturday and Sunday, and closed Mondays.

*I guess most locations like this needed to be staffed, just for security, because the surveillance technology wouldn't be able to tell them if someone was coming in and stealing every book off the shelf,* you explain to Ryouko. *And most people would be accessing it after school or work…*

. . . . .

A delinquent of some sort with messy hair, probably in high school, watches Ryouko cross the street as she leaves, just staring at her. It's kind of creepy. It feels like he's waiting for an errant breeze. Ryouko is disturbed. It's like he's wielding a power over her, with his eyes. She's not used to feeling vulnerable like that, and certainly not since she became a magical girl.

. . . . .

You decide to tour the Capitalism district, and find a selection of shops on the streets you pass by, though most don't seem to open until 9am to 9:30am. The major retail center proper does not open until 10:30am on weekdays.

*Right*, thinks Ryouko. \*Because everybody sleeps at night. All night. Every night. And I guess … children go to school earlier so the parents can go to work afterwards?

Probably.\*

You lurk around in one of the shops that is open for a few minutes, while someone makes a purchase. It appears that the current mode of Capitalism here is mostly based around physical exchange tokens, paper money and coins. You take down some prices.

. . . . .

Ryouko gets a strange message full of undecipherable characters. The phone buzzes a few seconds afterwards.

*Clarisse, what in the name of the goddess am I supposed to do with this? It's just a blob of data. None of it has any meaning.*

She gets another one before you get a chance to reply.

*Hold on, hold on, check it on the phone,* you tell her. *This may be an informative exercise.*

\<Nanami> Hey Shizuki#2. Shizuki Hitomi wants 2 know if u are bringing lunch or should we get 1 4 u
\<Nanami> P.S. btdubs we know you're a clone ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

*Well, food is solved, for the moment, anyway*, you observe.

*But how do I reply to this?* asks Ryouko, holding the phone awkwardly. \*There's only numeric input!

Hold on. I have an idea.\*

The phone buzzes with another message. This one was your responsibility.

*Aha! We can't call ourselves but we **can** message ourselves! I'll figure out the character set.*

You spam Hitomi's phone. *Oh, goddess, some of this is Governance standard but the rest is a variable length encoding. This will probably take a few tries. Stare at the phone for me?*

. . . . .

About 120 text messages later, you think you have a most of it down. It's a curious process. You note in the output tables a distinctive sequence of crude pictograms, which actually map to a code block of the standard governance encoding that you've never used before. It occurs to you this sort of system is probably where they must have come from — ghosts of the early information age.

*I think we're configured*, you tell her. *Want to give it a try?*

Ryouko concentrates, and texts back.

\<Hitomi> Why, yes, if you could bring a lunch I would be in your debt! Thank you ever so kindly.

A short while later there's a reply.

\<Nanami> np we got u grrrl

*Ah, the nuances of primitive dialects*, you remark.

**> offer suggestions to Ryouko**

It's about 10:00am; you've got about an hour and a half left. Any priorities besides wandering?
