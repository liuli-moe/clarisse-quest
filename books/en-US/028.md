# You could break someone’s heart that way, even if you don't mean to

Long update! I started writing plot but all that came out was madohomu. Oh well. You run with it.

\[4] Contact Nanami. Ask her for a recording of her finding Ryouko's body.

You send a text, and an apology that you keep bringing up a topic which may have been distressing, but it's important that you figure out what happened and some of it still doesn't make sense.

The files she sends back aren't that bad. Ryouko is in her ordinary clothes, and she looks… peaceful, like she's sleeping, eyes closed, hands folded across her chest. The ribbon has come undone from her hair somehow, and is neatly set up on top of her.

A small metal object is on the ground near her neck. You consider it carefully. For a moment, it seems to pulse weakly with a red glow. Is that her soul gem cover?

You try to consider what that means. The covers are not meant to be removed by third parties, so… maybe her soul disappeared in a case of magic exhaustion, trying to break free of the witch? She seems otherwise uninjured. Normally, her body would simply disappear, though, but if she is carrying a divine artifact, and if there's something that would break the rules of *two* different universes that might make her disappear, it's probably the prime candidate.

But then, who says they're even two different sets of rules? What if it's the same principle? A magical girl starts to turn into a witch, opening a labyrinth, but the Goddess stops it, collapsing the space even as it forms, taking her body with it. It's more elegant than having two separate rules for how the universe works.

You quietly add this to your list of evidence for your theory. It's not exactly a thesis you'd prefer to test again, but in a way, it's a heartening result, if the ribbon means the Goddess can still reach Ryouko.

You send Nanami a message of heartfelt thanks. \*That actually helped a lot.

I'm glad I could help, Clarisse\*, she sends back, then follows up with a message containing just one of those pictorial glyphs. ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")

Well, that's good. You suppose you needn't have worried quite so much.

**\[4+3] Share these strange tidings with the group, and conspire against Oriko**

You were aware that telecommunications in the twenty-first century were not what you were used to. You didn't expect low-latency high-quality 3D video calls. You were prepared to accept difficulty contacting people from time to time, a proliferation of poorly connected services. The problem of getting simple audio playback and low-quality still images in any given room, however, is not one you'd thought about.

You make a note to yourself to buy Homura a cell phone, just for your own peace of mind. In the meantime, you suppose, you can present to the group from your own.

"Wait," asks Homura. "You were on the phone just then? How?"

"Technological implants from the future," you say. "Among other things, I can make phone calls from my head. It's not even magic."

"That's… really weird!" says Homura.

"*Everybody* is a cyborg in the future," says Ryouko. "It's pretty normal. It might be more normal than the twentieth century is, actually, just by numbers."

"It's a little weird at first," says Madoka, "but it makes English homework really really easy."

Homura looks at Madoka questioningly. "Wait. You turned Madoka into a cyborg too?!?" asks Homura, shocked.

Madoka blushes.

"It seems that everyone who was on the roof is a cyborg now," you say, "*except* for you."

"It's not anyone's fault," says Ryouko. "It's more an unexpected side effect of a wish."

"… Everybody?" asks Homura.

"Everybody, plus, the kitty," confirms Ryouko.

Homura stares at the ground.

"I… uhh…" She hesitates.

***

After some stuttering and confusion, you determine that Homura was *briefly* a cyborg, but she erased the implants with magic because she thought the voices were demonic, some sort of attack she invited by using the horoscope.

"So I did an exorcism," she explains.

"An exorcism?" asks Ryouko. "Really?"

"I spent three years at a Catholic school in Tokyo," she says, "you learn a few exorcism prayers here and there!"

"They teach you exorcisms in Catholic school?" asks Madoka.

"N-no," says Homura, "but Sister Nana was always saying them!"

"Magical girls can … *change* themselves, to match their self-image," you explain. "That's probably what you did. Turned yourself back to normal."

"Yeah, well," she declares, "I'm a magical girl, not a — not a cyborg from the future!"

You place a hand on her shoulder. "It's okay, Homura. It's fine. Being true to yourself is an important part of being a magical girl. So if that means not being a cyborg, then it's okay."

"But …" she frets. "But now I'm just … left out of everything … again," she says, teetering at the edge of tears.

Madoka steps over to Homura, and takes her hand. "Homura," she says. "You're a magical girl. Everyone's always going to think you're cool."

"Yeah, well, not — not as cool as Ryouko," she says, dismissively.

"That's not right, Homura," says Madoka, shaking her head. "I mean, Ryouko came back four hundred years to save the future, and that *is* cool. But you came back just one month, right? Before that, you were just a student here, like the rest of us." She gives Homura a big hug. "I think that means a lot to everyone here, because you're one of us."

"I — I came back to save *you,*" says Homura. "Because you saved me."

Madoka smiles, her eyes closed. "Thank you, Homura."

"But — but I haven't even saved you yet," objects Homura.

"When the school was attacked," replies Madoka, "I realized something. I had been thinking that being a magical girl would be cool, and lots of fun. I thought, maybe this is what I should do with my life. But when Sayaka was missing, I realized it was a lot scarier than I thought. I didn't think I could do it anymore." She opens her eyes, and looks at Homura. "But you know … if someone who's just like me can be a magical girl, well, then, maybe I could be one too. Maybe I can be *anything*."

"You can definitely be a magical girl," says Homura. "I saw it. You … you looked out for me when no one else did. You tried to save everyone. I just wanted to do the same for you…"

***

Ryouko is considering the theological implications.

*It's easy to get used to it, but… Akemi Homura is **not** supposed to be the cutest little thing ever,* she observes.

You play devil's advocate for a moment. \*What if she really fundamentally is? And the future is where it's all wrong.

Maybe\*, considers Ryouko.

You contemplate further. \*What do you suppose makes her different?

Clarisse, \*asks Ryouko, *how would you feel if I died, and you made a wish to bring me back, but then I went off to join the Goddess anyway, and left you here waiting? How would you feel four hundred years later?*

You shudder.\* I don't know,\* you reply. \*I can't begin to know. But… that's a scary thought.

How would I feel,\* asks your girl,\* leaving you behind?\*

Oh, goddess.

*The thing that would weigh on me the most if you left me behind would be not knowing whether or not you were okay,* you tell your girl.\* And as much as I'd feel lost and alone without you, it would be much, much worse to imagine you hurting because of me. So if anything ever does happen, remember that the most important thing to me is your well being. You're not ever allowed to despair for my sake, okay? Because I'd want you to get better, and to go on to be all you can be.

Well. Let's hope it doesn't come to that,\* she replies.

*Yes*, you agree.\* Let's hope it doesn't, then do our best to make sure.\*

Homura attempts to apologize for making a scene, but Ryouko won't let her, insisting that it's all fine.

***

Where were you, anyway?

**\[4+3] Share these strange tidings with the group, and conspire against Oriko**
\- \[4] Focus on discussing implications with the group

Right. The four of you huddle around, and you play back the call over the cell phone.

"Well," says Ryouko, after it finishes, "that's not what I expected at all."

"It sounds like she had a plan for you which she abandoned," you postulate, "didn't know that we'd call, didn't even know that you're alive, and that she wanted to recruit Homura for some scheme or another."

Ryouko nods. "And she wants Asami to head back home as soon as she finds Hitomi."

You take a deep breath. "There's a chance she's talking about Simona."

"… What?" asks Ryouko. "She said my *lover*."

"Yes, but this is a message from *Oriko*. She could just be using the words to manipulate Hitomi somehow. Or Simona, for that matter."

Ryouko boggles. "You think Simona wants to be my…"

"Ryouko," you interrupt. "I try not to meddle too much in matters of love. You should be making your own choices, and it's *mostly* not my job to protect you from yourself there.

"But why would you think she'd want … that?" asks Ryouko.

"... I'm not sure I should talk about it in front of the others," you push back.

"It's *perfectly fine*," she insists. "If you're really not about manipulating, just *tell me*, Clarisse."

You sigh. "It's pretty clear that she was *moments away from confessing her love to you* when the two of you were attacked."

Ryouko's eyes go wide. "She was — wait. No. No!!! But then… when I saw her after Asami…"

"*Yes.*"

"Oh, and then… and *then* there was the Incubator who said he wanted to *observe*… oh, no."

\*"*Oh*, yes," \*you say, rubbing your temples.

"Oh goddess…" she says.

Madoka reaches over to Ryouko, taking her hand. "Ryouko," she says, "when you were playing with Yuuka earlier, and she was feeding you, did you actually mean to be flirting with her?"

"… No?" she replies in a helpless tone.

"I didn't think so," she says, "but it really looked an awful lot like you were."

"Really?"

"You should be careful," says Madoka. "You could break someone's heart that way, even if you don't mean to."

Ryouko nods, wordlessly.

A moment of quiet follows.

"So," Homura begins, "umm… do you think I should meet Oriko?"

\[3] Scheme to have Homura call and meet with Oriko

"Well, it's up to you, of course," you say. "I'd support you if you did. In fact, if you'd like, you could call her yourself and arrange a meeting even sooner than Friday."

"But that's risky too," says Ryouko. "I can't imagine she expected Yuma to be the one answering the phone. She wouldn't expect us to have her number. So it lets her know something's up right away."

You consider. "The question is really whether it's riskier to let her know you survived," you say, "or riskier to keep doing, well, *anything*, without hearing from her exactly what she's up to."

Homura considers. "She said that she wanted to beat Walpurgisnacht, *and* all the other witches. But… that's exactly what I want to hear. So… I'm not sure I can trust her. It's probably not true. "

"I don't think it's worth it," says Ryouko. "I don't trust her. Even if she's telling the truth, she did her best to get us assassinated. Good intentions just don't justify that sort of thing, ever."

"I — I'm not sure about Friday, then, either," says Homura. "If I went alone, what could I do?"

"Well, what *can* you do?" you ask. "Exactly?"

"Well," says Homura, "that's the thing. I, um… I have this shield. It projects a defensive barrier — a small one, not too special — and I can sort of reach in and put things inside it in a pocket space that's much bigger on the inside. And, well, of course, I can use it stop time. Only, you two are immune for some reason, which is totally unfair."

You nod. "That's *probably* because of Ryouko's ribbon, and it only seems to apply when we're close. Which is probably for the best — it'd be rather disruptive if you got in a fight and stopped time while we were talking to people somewhere else."

"How long does it last?" asks Ryouko.

"… What?" asks Homura.

"I mean, how long can you keep time stopped?"

"No," says Homura, "I mean… the question doesn't make sense! It's *stopped*. There's no *how long* anymore."

"So you can just keep time stopped until it drains your magic?" you ask.

"… No?" she replies.

"I'm confused," you say. "What do you mean, then?"

"I mean I can keep time stopped," explains the girl, "and it doesn't drain my magic at all."

"You can do ***what**?*" you exclaim.

Ryouko stares at her with wide eyes. "Good goddess."

Your eyes are pretty wide as well. "Homura… That is impossible. That is unbelievable. That is, hands down, the single most powerful feat of magic I've ever heard of. Ever. It's not even close."

"See? You're *much* cooler than I am," says Ryouko.

"… But I can't *do* anything with it!" she exclaims. "I had to b-beat up the witch with Sayaka's baseball bat!"

"You beat up a witch with a blunt weapon and muscle power … and it worked?" you ask.

"Badly!" she exclaims.

"You can damage witches without magic, then," you explain. "What if you brought along something like a submachine gun?"

"A *what?!?*" exclaims Homura. "B— but … that's not really a magical girl thing!"

"I'm a magical girl," says Ryouko, "and I use guns all the time. They won't let you fend off alien invasions without them, actually. Then you can save your magic for important things."

"You would look *badass* with a submachine gun," you tell Homura.

"And — you can carry it around in your pocket space," continues Ryouko. "It's perfect!"

Homura looks to Madoka, as if pleading for help.

"Why not try it?" asks Madoka.

Homura takes a deep breath. "Okay…"

"We'll figure out how to get you one," says Ryouko.

"Maybe not a *sub-machine gun*," you say. "But something. And, in the meantime, we can team up. Nanami has a little railgun pistol she can loan you, which is absolutely devastating. If you can just stop time… the two of you could be the most efficient witch hunting team *ever*."

"… And if one of you is out hunting then Ryouko can teleport you all there when it's time to fight," says Madoka. "It's perfect!"

"… Except, *perhaps*, against Oriko," you say. "Who *might* have her own ribbons. Which might even work."

"Might?" asks Homura.

"I'm not entirely convinced she didn't just steal Madoka's hair ribbons," you say.

"She did what?!" asks Madoka.

"They didn't seem to stop time when we first met you and they were on your head, though," you allow. "So at a guess, they're not actually magical."

"But… but, why would she even think they were?" asks Homura.

"It might be hard to tell one ribbon from another in a vision," proposes Ryouko. "Maybe she just got confused?"

Homura makes a skeptical face.

"Well, anyway," you say, in an attempt at distraction, "why don't we see whether we can find Homura some sort of a weapon by Friday? Then can practice in a witch's barrier, where no one notices it."

Ryouko nods. "We won't make Oriko suspicious, and if she *does* have a way to counter your power, you're not defenseless."

The small girl with red glasses and pigtails nods. "Okay. Guns, then. Lots of guns. And maybe… bombs?"

Madoka giggles.

"We'll ask everyone for ideas on how to make that happen," says Ryouko.

"There's one other thing we need to do," you say, looking at Homura. "For my peace of mind, and for the sake of everybody here, we *need* to get you a cell phone."

"Oh, oh," says Madoka, "I know where you should go! There's a shop in the mall. We should probably head over there before it closes, though."

You nod. "Just one more thing before we go," you ask. "You've mentioned Walpurgisnacht a few times. What is it exactly? A witch, obviously, but…"

"Yeah, it's a really powerful witch," says Homura, quietly. "It's legendary. It doesn't have a labyrinth, it just wreaks destruction, like earthquakes and tsunamis. It came to Mitakihara on the last day of April, and, none of the magical girls could stop it, and a lot of people died."

You nod. "And that's when you made your wish."

"We'll get it this time," says Homura. "It's the one thing I'm certain of. And I'll keep… I'll keep *everybody* safe," she declares.

Madoka smiles. "We're in good hands, Homura."

***

You pet Amy, and say goodbye; she's happy to enjoy the last of a sunbeam, and you get ready to set out on a shopping expedition with the other two. You should have a little downtime once you get home to meet back up with Hitomi, and figure out what to do about her father this evening.

\[5] Split the grief seeds with Homura.

In exchange for a cell phone and all your grief cubes earlier, Homura was more than happy to share the unexpected bounty. Ryouko stashes her two seeds in her handbag for now; you make a note to look at them later.

What else were you thinking of doing just now?

\[1] Scheme to leave a body in Oriko's bed, to send a message
(Apologies for turning this reasonable idea into such a big deal. I assure you, I'm not trying to send a message to you, the voters, by treating it like this, and I'm not trying to call you out. But I considered the contents of the vote in the context of the girls surrounding you, and I think it works well here like this and subtly advances indirect plots. Please do not feel discouraged from voting like this, not for my sake anyway!)

It's a strangely compelling idea. It would definitely getting her attention. She doesn't strike you as the type that would be unaffected by that. If she's going to be in the assassination game and hide from the consequences through intermediaries… she deserves it. Let her squirm. The only question is where you'd get a dead body. And…

Actually…

Wow. That's kind of dark. You've sort of shocked yourself.

Where did that come from? Is it just because Ryouko is threatened? Or has something else changed about you since you became more human?

You doubt yourself, pondering as the others walk along, making light conversation.

When you get down to it, is it really much different than Ryouko's bloodlust in battle? You love her and accept her for who she is, and that's a part of her. Maybe this is just how the same part manifests in you? You're just less of a hands-on sort of girl…

Oh. Are you rationalizing now? If Ryouko does it, is it all okay?

Oh, goddess.

It's... probably fine. Just a passing thought. It's not like you really planned to act on it. It won't harm anyone.

You tag along quietly for the rest of the expedition. Madoka takes you to a place in the mall downtown, with prices which she assures you are very good. It's a pretty cluttered place, but she quickly manages to find a cute looking flip phone with shiny purple accents, and Homura talks with a salesman about a pre-paid plan for students. You quietly slip her some cash while he's not looking.

***

"Hello! We're back!" you say, as you re-enter the Shizuki household.

"Oh, welcome back, Ryouko, Clarisse," says Hitomi's mother, walking in from another room.

"Is Hitomi back yet?" asks Ryouko.

"No, she called to say she'd be running late," she replies. "Shouldn't be much longer. And I'm just about to step out for a quick errand myself. If I'm not back by the time her father gets home, chide him for me for being early, okay?"

"Okay…" responds Ryouko, though she's skeptical of this notion.

***

"Well then," you observe, "home alone?"

"Yeah," says Ryouko. "Just the two of us."

"That's… different," you consider. "I mean, we've been alone together before when you've been alone, but.."

"Yeah," says Ryouko. "I know."

She's thinking about that. You'd almost rather she didn't.

"Was there anything that you always wanted to do," she asks, "if this happened?"

"I, um… I dunno," you fib. "It's still all sort of unreal to me."

"Okay," says Ryouko.

"Maybe when I'm a little more used to … things," you hedge.

She nods. "In that case, I think I'm just going to lounge here on this couch, and relax, and take a break. This has been an *insane* day."

"That makes a lot of sense," you say, "I'll do the same. I'll sit here and … send messages."

Your girl giggles. "*That's* what you call relaxing?"

"It's *normal*," you explain. "I'll follow up with some research, while we have wi-fi."

\[1] Keep Nanami informed

You compose a summary update as you head out, and attach the recording of the call. *Any ideas where we can get Homura some weapons?* you enquire. Asking seems a little weird… mostly because, of all the girls, she might actually have the inklings of an idea.

\[1] Keep the others informed

You send out a more condensed version, letting them know that it looks like Oriko's behind everything, that you found Homura, she's hanging out with Madoka, be nice to her if you meet them… she has a new phone number. (You leave out the bit about the guns, for the moment, pending Nanami's reply.)

You're following up with some basic research, scouting out the area of the train station and pleasantly surprised to find crude VR models and recent satellite imagery available online, free of charge *and* of advertisement. You set about downloading a variety of these data, to refer to later. It might *technically* be a violation of the terms of service, but that depends on how they want to legally define the user-agent. You're adding a few other key corridors to your *umwelt* and accessing additional data about firearms regulations and local policing standards when you hear the door opening.

"Ah," says Ryouko, stretching and rising to her feet, "that's probably Hitomi; it's a little early for Mrs. Shizuki to be …"

She stops mid-sentence, in surprise.

You quickly switch over to her sensory inputs to see…

"Surprise!" says Hitomi's father, smiling, setting down a light suitcase at the door, and taking off his suit jacket. "I got an early flight, and I got home early! Is your mother here?" He turns to face Ryouko, looks at her, and pauses. You must be visible just past her, on one of the chairs.

"Uhh," mumbles Ryouko awkwardly. \*Where's Hitomi? \*she asks you, internally.

\*I don't know! \*You've already dialed her, but the call has just connected — straight to her voicemail. *She's still on Do Not Disturb. And I don't have any way to escalate it with these ancient protocols!*

"Hitomi?" asks Mr. Shizuki, suddenly serious, concern in his voice. "Did you … did something …" He stares at her a moment, and something seems to catch his eye.

Ryouko stands there like a deer caught in the headlights.

"Oh, no," says Hitomi's father, the concern in his voice quickly giving way to what must simply be panic. "Oh, Hitomi, angel, oh, no, you didn't, please, please tell me you didn't," He drops his jacket on the floor, dashes over to Ryouko very quickly, and takes her by the hand.

With wild eyes, he turns his attention first to Ryouko's ring, then to the green star on her fingernail, with an expression of abject shock and despair.

"No… no," he says, "anything but that…"

Ryouko is stunned by this attention. *Clarisse!* she cries out internally. \*He knows! How does he know?

Oh, goddess. \*She's clearly right. *That doesn't matter right now, just — reassure him!*

Ryouko takes a breath, and jerks her hand away. "I'm not —" she gulps, "I'm not Hitomi!"

Mr. Shizuki just stands there a moment, startled, and processing. He steals a quick glance at you, meets your eyes with an incisive gaze, then turns back to look at Ryouko.

"Then would you care to tell me, young miss," he demands, evenly, "what in the name of all that is good has been done to her?" His tone suggests that he would be quite ready to flip out and kill someone if he doesn't like the answer.

"She's still at … dance class," says Ryouko, doing her best not to freak out. "But she's running late, and … she's turned off her phone, so we can't reach her."

Squids and aliens are one thing; family members prepared to embark on the war-path, apparently, are another: your girl is afraid. She sends you a silent little cry for *help*, barely managing the thought word.

You stand up in a swift motion. "Mr. Shizuki," you call out, mustering a sense of courage you wouldn't have even known this morning that you'd ever need to use, walking over to approach him, and look him in the eye. "You clearly possess significant knowledge of these matters already, so I will do my best to explain. The girl in front of you is Shizuki Ryouko. She is a magical girl from the twenty fifth century, and has been sent back in time to save the future. She is, to the best of my knowledge, your great great great somethingth great granddaughter, by matrilineal descent, all the way up to your daughter, Hitomi."

Mr. Shizuki's eyes are very wide. He looks to Ryouko, and then slowly looks back to you, and he opens his mouth, as if searching for words.

You sigh. "And I'm her … clone."

Mr. Shizuki takes a deep breath.

"Her name is Clarisse," adds Ryouko.

He takes another breath.

"Well then," he finally says, voice quavering slightly, and body shaking. "It's a pleasure to have the two of you here. If you'll excuse me just a moment… I think I need to sit down."

"Of course," you say. "Do you need any help?"

"That might be prudent. If you would be so kind?" he replies. "Just over to the sofa, if you please."

You offer him your shoulder. "We're quite sorry for having caused you concern. It's been quite a day for everyone."

He nods, settling down on the couch.

"Better?" you ask.

"I'll be fine," he says. "You girls just gave me a fright, is all. I was afraid that Hitomi might have been approached by a demon, in the form of a white cat, and sold her soul for a wish, and that you were… well, I wasn't sure what exactly."

"To the best of my knowledge," you say, "she has not. I don't even think she has any magical potential. And… we're trying not to mix her up in things any more than we can help it."

He takes a deep breath once more, exhales, and for the first time since he noticed Ryouko, lets loose a bit of a smile.

"Well now," he says. "At least there's that." He squeezes your hand.
