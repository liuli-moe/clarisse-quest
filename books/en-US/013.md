# Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Too much fighting! ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(") You'll make the megucas cry. As ~~punishment~~, have a surprise unexpected early update. That'll teach you.

It is quiet. It is dark. You're not quite sure what's going on, but are somehow unafraid; you sense somehow that you've been here before. You are a little worried about Ryouko, however. Where is she? Your memory is in fragments. Who is Ryouko? Besides someone very precious? Someone is here with you, quietly. Gentle hands are braiding your hair. Or Ryouko's hair? Maybe both. The fragments of memory and self slowly come back together. It's a little better than before. A vision, perhaps?

\[7] various Save Mami's Gem plans
\[7] various Surrender plans
\[1] don't surrender (hug Mami instead)
(Aww.)

Your girl was on the rooftop. You'd laid out the options, explained your indecision. Her choice was clear.

*Homura! Do your thing!* she telepathed. *We have to save Mami!*

Homura stopped time, and —

— Ryouko was walking downstairs with Homura and a nervous looking Wakaba, who were holding hands. Homura explained her power as she went along.

"Normally I have to be touching for you to move," she explained; "I don't know why Ryouko's an exception. She s-shouldn't be."

"Clarisse has a couple of ideas," says Ryouko. "We should talk about them later."

Ryouko rounded a corner and encountered several of Wakaba's friends in the hallway.

"Okay," said Wakaba, nodding meekly, "I'll explain to them like you said."

"Good," said Ryouko. "Now, let's go back up to" —

… there's a bit of a gap in the memory. Ryouko and Homura had jumped over by Mami. No clear readout on the gem — below a certain point the clouds of darkness are simply inconsistent, so you need to sample over a couple of seconds — but it's critically low. Ryouko was in the middle of saying something to Homura about why she was fighting with Mami.

"It'll be okay," said Ryouko, "I brought several grief cubes. The trick will be applying them without her trying to kill me."

" — cubes?" asked Homura, nervously.

Ryouko nods. "I suppose you haven't been a magical girl for very long? When you use magic, your soul gem collects impurities. Grief cubes clean the impurities, restoring your magic. You can find them by hunting demons." She took out three of them, holding them in her left hand. "I suppose they wouldn't work in a time stop," she ponders, "or if they did, maybe they'd start time for her, too…"

"D— demons?" asks Homura, nervously.

Ryouko nodded.

She stared at Mami's soul gem intently. "Okay. This will be a bit of precision operation, but I think I can manage it," she said. "I'm just going to take her soul gem a short distance away, so that she can't use magic. About 150 meters or so, just to be safe. That way," she pointed, gesturing.

Homura frowned.

Ryouko moved forward, carefully focusing on the gem, preparing to gingerly grab it in between her fingers and port away. She completely tuned out Homura moving behind her—

and was struck on the back of the head. Not a hard strike, but she was thrown off-balance, and ran into Mami. Homura stood there, with a baseball bat. She hadn't been carrying it a moment before…

*She trusts Mami over us,* you realized, a moment too late. It made sense; she's had a month of the future to get to know her. She'd even mentioned the name before. You'd tried to distract the others from the matter, to protect her secret.

Mami cried out, as she began moving again. "No!!!" She twisted her body to shove Ryouko away with a knee, as Ryouko frantically snatched at Mami's hair, and jumped—

That must have been what like teleporting into a brick wall feels like. Mami's soul, and several locks of her hair, tumbled from Ryouko's grasp, onto the ground, as Ryouko's time slammed to a halt —

Time was running again. Easy to tell, really, because of the chaos, potent, concentrated, nightmares pouring out in front of Ryouko's eyes. Like the last time, but worse.

You'd activated the emotional suppression, so your girl was calmly rational.

*I suppose I needed to stay closer to the center of the time stop,* she was thinking to herself. \*Probably within 100 meters, if I had to guess.

Now's not the time for that sort of regret,\* you said to her. \*What is \****that?***

It was a freakishly distorted monster, a garish doll with a distorted figure, hair covering its eyes. Its legs were bound together.

*It feels like a wraith,* noted Ryouko, *A weird, mutant, baby wraith. Why? How? Where are we?*

… more gaps and chaos, though somehow, not quite as dense chaos …

Ryouko's hands and feet were tied together with red ribbons; she lay on the ground, writihng, helpless. Couldn't escape. Couldn't even teleport.

A quivering Homura stepped forward to meet another thing that was not a wraith — much larger than the others, and far more garish. It was like an ugly doll, without a face, except of course too huge. A giant price tag, or gift tag, was attached to its back.

*But there's no way she'll manage it,* Ryouko thought —

***

The vision seems to have passed in your recollection. So where is your girl now?

What is now?

It is Wednesday. It is six o'clock in the morning. Ryouko is comfortably asleep. She seems to be having a pleasant dream. Something is wrong, though, besides missing Tuesday, besides the fact that your girl is asleep. It's rather hard to place. You're not really yourself, status indicators notwithstanding. Something about your sensory perception, a minor echo, a hard-to-place tingle. Perhaps a more thorough diagnostic would be in order, before you wake your girl. You give it a few moments.

Nothing's wrong. If anything, it's all unrealistically right. Both Ryouko *and* yourself are operating well *above* normal ranges, by every reading. Under other circumstances, you might suspect that the diagnostics have been tampered with. Under these circumstances, however, another explanation begins to present itself as more likely. You're not sure you like the implications, as they require you to imagine traumatic, life-ending events happening to *your* girl, not just once, but maybe twice. This is undoubtedly a bad sign.

*Ryouko,* you call, gently. \*It's time to wake up.

But… but — \*her unconscious state protests.

*We can have real cake later. With real strawberries,* you promise.

She begrudgingly opens her eyes, staring at the ceiling.

… She doesn't recognize the ceiling. \*Clarisse? Where are we?

Wednesday morning, 6 am, Mitakihara 2011. Somewhere in a residential district, I think.\*

She checks her chronometer to verify. The covers are soft, and light. Ryouko is wearing a nightgown.

*Okay, I'll get up*, she says, sliding her legs over the side of the bed…

Ryouko has excellent reflexes. She does *not* tumble to the ground, but rather catches herself quite well.

*In a bunk bed,* you add.

\*… The ceiling was so high, though! \*She looks up. The ceiling is high indeed. She's landed on soft carpet, next to a pair of her favorite slippers. She looks at them, confused, then gingerly slips them onto her feet. Yes, they're the same ones.

\*Clarisse, what happened? My memory's choppy. Again.

I know. I don't like it.

Clarisse… did something bad happen to us?

I really, really hope not,\* you tell her. \*But I'm running out of alternative hypotheses.

… Clarisse, did we die?

I really, really hope not.\*

Ryouko walks over to the window, and throws open the curtains. Outside is the light of dawn, and the well-sculpted grounds of a nice white house.

With the increase in light, you register another difficult-to-place, tingly feeling.

*Ryouko, I don't know what it is, but something's wrong. I'm not feeling myself.*

She frowns, twirls back around, and takes in the room. It's a large space, furnished with simple but elegant pieces: two uncluttered desks by the windows, two bureaus, two vanities. It looks like there's a closet, and maybe an en suite bathroom. A single bunk bed, the bottom, occupied by a sleeping girl with long lilac hair, her face towards the wall.

*Who is she?* asks Ryouko.

*I don't know.*

Ryouko approaches carefully, listening to her breathing. Not a magical girl, at least. The only soul gem nearby is safely on Ryouko's finger.

*Do you intend to wake her?* you enquire.

She gently touches the girl's shoulder. "Hello?" she whispers. Then, she shakes, gently.

You are acutely distracted. Something is very much not right, and getting worse.

Ryouko shakes harder; the girl rolls over and opens her eyes.

The tingly feeling you've been experiencing suddenly resolves into a flood of unexpected multi-sensory data. You are looking at an image of Ryouko, who is contemplating the face in front of her as you contemplate hers. You have a feeling of physical warmth, and another feeling of emotional warmth, and a kinesthetic sense overlay of a girl lying on her back in a bed.

"Hello?" asks Ryouko. "I'm sorry to wake you, but…"

"Aah!" squeals the lilac girl.

"Oh, I'm sorry," begins Ryouko —

The girl turns, reaching out with her right hand, to touch Ryouko on the cheek. The vicarious sensation of Ryouko's sensory feed arrives just a few milliseconds behind the sensation in your fingertips.

"Aaaaah!" You scream, externally, then place your hands over your mouth. "But I'm — I'm still — Ryouko, what happened!??" You're breathing heavily.

"I— I'm sorry," says Ryouko, "who are you?"

The lilac-haired girl with Ryouko's face blinkblink, blinkblinkblink, blinkblinks rapidly. Your heart beats rapidly, you tremble, and you half-open your mouth, unable to make coherent words.

But you're still in both places, somehow, so you can do *this,* instead.

*Ryouko,* you tell her in a panic,\* it's ME.\*

Ryouko stares at you for five whole seconds, trying to process this notion.

*Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah*, you scream, internally.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" screams Ryouko.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" you scream, externally.

You reach forward again, to take your girl by the hand. Fingertips. Your fingertips against her fingertips, an impossibility. Your girl is warm. Your heart is warm.

"But how are you — how are you in both places?!?" she asks in confusion.

"I have no idea either!!!" you insist. Wait. "Wait. No — maybe somebody — maybe somebody made a w—"

The door suddenly opens, and a girl is standing there in a nightgown that perfectly matches yours and Ryouko's.

"… Hitomi?" asks Ryouko.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" cries Hitomi. "What are you doing here?!? H— How are there two of you?"

"This is Clarisse," explains Ryouko.

"But — but you — Ryouko, we all thought you were dead!" she cries out, running towards Ryouko, tears flowing from her eyes, embracing her.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" you cry. "I was afraid it was that!"

"… What?!?" asks Hitomi.

"I — I think we died," says Ryouko, "and someone must have wished us back, but … I don't know who, or why we're here, or why Clarisse is a — a girl, or…"

"Wished you back?" asks Hitomi, confused.

You continue to freak out. "Oh goddess we didn't get to that part okay listen Hitomi listen *magical girls all get wishes* it's all part of the contract — if you have potential, you can see the—"

You are interrupted as a woman's voice calls out from the distance. "*Would you three girls please quiet down?*"

Hitomi swallows. "Y-yes, Mama!" she calls back. "I'm sorry!"

"Thank you!" replies the voice.

"Oh goddess she knows there are three of us here, I didn't even know! how does she know. *how does she know?!"* you babble.

"I don't know — and, and, I thought Clarisse was invisible!" exclaims Hitomi.

"It must have been a wish oh goddess *who would have made the wish.* let's see, not Hitomi not Homura that leaves a likely onetwothree-four, five…"

"Clarisse, calm down!" says Ryouko, a little desperately.

You pause a moment. "I don't know how to calm down!!!" you reply. Your consciousness is awash with unexpected sensations and neurotransmitters. You're not yourself! … Well, at least not the self that you're used to.

"Take deep breaths!" says Hitomi.
