*why did you put a heart in it? that looks stupid, you —*
No, stop it, you're second-guessing yourself.
*you should have put 'my dearest Kyouko'*
but... that's not fair, you shouldn't Ryouko is still dearer
*you used it earlier*
well you're sorry, and — seriously! Enough of this. It's done.

Right, what else was there?

\[4] get better enumeration of Nanami powers, with interest in getting new implants

Well, she said she was going to go to the hospital, but maybe you have just a moment to catch her yet.

\<Clarisse> Hey, Nanami
\<Clarisse> are you busy at the hospital yet?
\<Nanami> naah, still got a few minutes
\<Nanami> I hopped on a late-night bus
\<Nanami> What's up?
\<Clarisse> I was walking home with Ryouko and wondering something.
\<Clarisse> What exactly are your powers?
\<Clarisse> You said something about them being electric earlier, but I think that might have just been to be vague about the railgun.
\<Nanami> Right. So… well, they're like, futuristic-technology powers.
\<Nanami> This is literally the label attached to the power, which the reference literature tells me is a thing.
\<Nanami> The magical girl reference literature is also a thing, but I'm pretty sure it's more a wish results thing than a power thing, and many of the institutions it describes are not a thing.
\<Clarisse> Right, that makes sense…
\<Nanami> So, enchanting things into pieces of technology is a thing I can do. Diagnosis and tuning of future-tech pieces is another one; I can, like, get a vague sense of its health and wellness.
\<Nanami> The catch is, the less I know about the tech, the harder it is, and the more magic it would take.
\<Nanami> *Fortunately,* I seem to have extensive documentation, which is going to help a *lot*.
\<Clarisse> I see.
\<Clarisse> In practical terms, then, the first thing I was wondering was whether it might be possible for you to recreate a tactical computer, the kind that you're running with.
\<Clarisse> If so, we should think further about whether it'd be a good idea to outfit Homura or Kyouko.
\<Nanami> Well, that's an interesting question.
\<Nanami> If I were to just enchant it up, the computer would be a drain on my magic. But if I were to enchant up some nanobots, and those nanobots made more nanobots, and those went on to do the normal installation… that would be fine. Especially since they're small, and I have prototypes at hand. That makes it all a lot easier. Still not *super* low-magic, but doable, as an investment goes, probably a good one? I'd have to do some research and get back to you on the specific requirements.
\<Nanami> But, I'm not entirely certain it's a great idea.
\<Clarisse> Well, I've been weighing the pros and cons.
\<Nanami> Here's one thing for you to consider, then.
\<Nanami> The version of tactical computer that I have isn't quite as smart as you.
\<Clarisse> Yes? version 1.8 is a sub-sentient artificial intelligence.
\<Nanami> So it does a few helpful things that don't quite entirely make sense sometimes, small mistakes. Still self tuning things like its suggestion capabilities.
\<Nanami> so imagine, Kyouko has this computer, and wanted to look up data related to Homura-chan, perhaps to file a picture near some other pictures, and among the selections the 1.8 tac-comp suggests is an encyclopedia page filled with some very interesting things.
\<Nanami> Imagine that she is curious, and wonders what that result is all about.
\<Clarisse> … oh goddess
\<Nanami> Yes, or if she looks up Akemi-sama's goddess, and learns about a nice little church slash cult, holy days on October Third, and the person who *founded* the cult
\<Nanami> And there's hypertext everywhere, and the AI is doing its best to be helpful, so it points to Mami-san, and Kyouko, and Ryouko.
\<Nanami> oh, and she might learn about that movie about Ryouko which is coming out in a few centuries
\<Nanami> incidentally, it sounds like maybe some of that was just being the right place at the right time, but I am legit impressed anyway
\<Clarisse> yesssss
\<Clarisse> the release of the movie is definitely a thing and, um, going to be a little life changing
\<Nanami> more so than being the big hero in the first place?
\<Clarisse> No, I mean, for *me.*
\<Clarisse> version two tactical computers are very new and, um, we weren't strictly designed to be sentient.
\<Clarisse> surprisingly enough putting sentient beings physically inside other sentient beings *is not normal*
\<Clarisse> so I'm more or less an accident, and I'm trying hard to make it a *happy* accident
\<Clarisse> and while I do not resent being created, and I cherish my role
\<Clarisse> they shouldn't have done it, and it is going to attract some attention, and I'm not yet sure *what* will be unleashed
\<Nanami> holy fuck
\<Clarisse> actually, this experience here is likely to be informative
\<Clarisse> I will have to review my notes on the topics of philosophy and ethics afterwards
\<Clarisse> If I get a moment, I might go back to Plato and Socrates
\<Nanami> … so, um, wow, that's kind of something.
\<Clarisse> well, I spend time around Ryouko. *wow, that's kind of something* seems to be part of the territory
\<Clarisse> was there anything else in your reading that grabbed your interest?
\<Nanami> well, I did find a troubling little footnote in history
\<Nanami> a short story about one Miki Sayaka who gave her all in a demon attack and perished
\<Clarisse> … Here's something for you that's not in that encyclopedia.
\<Clarisse> I'd guess fewer than ten people know it, actually.
\<Clarisse> That attack was an assassination, orchestrated by Oriko.
\<Nanami> Well now, that's not *absolutely terrifying* in the slightest, is it?
\<Clarisse> Oh, but then, you've looked up demons, too, I assume… :/
\<Nanami> oh yes, and grief cubes
\<Clarisse> YOU SAW NOTHING
\<Clarisse> DO NOT SPEAK THOSE WORDS ALOUD
\<Clarisse> DO NOT SHARE THOSE WORDS WITH THE UNINITIATED
\<Clarisse> AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT MENTION THEM TO KYUUBEY
\<Nanami> whoa-kay, noted
\<Clarisse> Okay so explanation
\<Clarisse> We brought 13 with us from the future, just because Ryouko had them on her person
\<Clarisse> *Oriko got us killed* and it might have been just to get at them
\<Clarisse> We think she's breeding more demons with them
\<Clarisse> Kyuubey wants them all gone
\<Clarisse> I don't know how far he'll go to make it happen
\<Clarisse> We have recovered some of them, but not all
\<Clarisse> They may have also been the reason that last witch was acting so strangely and demanding violence
\<Clarisse> At the same time, we are unsure whether returning them is the wisest course of action
\<Clarisse> They may be a great boon to magical girls who might otherwise perish of magic exhaustion
\<Nanami> I see, I see, how dangerously interesting
\<Clarisse> also Kyuubey *might have thought* it was Simona who brought them
\<Clarisse> so in the event you end up talking to him about them (perhaps shortly after you discover some on your own)
\<Clarisse> maybe even consider calling them like *squares* or *dice* or something like that
\<Clarisse> *definitely* don't mention anything about us, or even about her
\<Clarisse> and we also need to talk about one other *dangerously interesting* topic
\<Clarisse> but ideally we should do that one in person, out of an abundance of caution
\<Clarisse> tomorrow afternoon, perhaps, with Homura and Kyouko?
\<Nanami> I shall await it with eager anticipation
\<Clarisse> oh no please don't do that
\<Clarisse> you really don't want to know
\<Clarisse> I don't think you can get away with not-knowing
\<Clarisse> but there will be no joy that with of knowing
\<Nanami> Ah. Well then..
\<Nanami> fuck.
\<Clarisse> *yes, very much so*

\[4] discourage Sayaka from ally of justice ideas

\<Clarisse> but in any event, I've also been hoping to follow up with Sayaka
\<Clarisse> I am slightly afraid that she might make a wish over something
\<Clarisse> I should hate for it to be over something small we could do with tech or magic
\<Nanami> hey Clarisse
\<Nanami> you know what?
\<Nanami> this situation?
\<Nanami> it is an absolute clusterfuck
\<Clarisse> Yes!!
\<Clarisse> Hello ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Clarisse> Welcome to my world
\<Clarisse> Glad to have you on board ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Clarisse> Fortunately, clusterfuck mitigation is one of my specialties
\<Nanami> yeah I mean, like,
\<Nanami> I was wondering before why of all the times and places in the universe you'd travel to *this one?*
\<Nanami> and *that makes sense now*, but the real question just moves somewhere else nearby
\<Nanami> is there a particular reason that the crux of human history runs through my middle school class like this?
\<Clarisse> I'm not sure?
\<Clarisse> Madoka is definitely a part of it
\<Clarisse> and honestly it might also have something to do with Homura
\<Clarisse> especially if she's taken the initiative to save her from something
\<Clarisse> honestly, she's the prime mover for an awful lot of history
\<Clarisse> or a lot of alternate-future-history, at least
\<Nanami> … clarisse, be honest with me
\<Nanami> did I screw everything up
\<Nanami> did I ruin the future with a stupid wish
\<Clarisse> no, I'm pretty sure things were weird before you made your wish
\<Nanami> yeah but like, it's *really intense wish magic*
\<Nanami> *the cause and effect is allowed to be backwards*
\<Nanami> they told me so in the reference literature
\<Clarisse> … even then, I think reaching into an alternate future to change things is slightly beyond the pale
\<Clarisse> supposing for a moment a crazy multi-universe causality inversion *does* somehow run through you, I'd still hazard that it's the fault of some greater forces at work, and not your fault
\<Nanami> then why, when I read about the future, does it feel like I've *ruined everything*
\<Clarisse> oh, Nanami
\<Clarisse> you really haven't, okay?
\<Clarisse> good candidates to blame for ruining things include Oriko, and maybe Simona
\<Nanami> okay fine, but, even then
\<Nanami> what about what I did to *you*
\<Clarisse> well
\<Clarisse> it's not something I would have picked
\<Clarisse> but still a lot better than Ryouko and I being dead, isn't it?
\<Clarisse> I think I'm mostly intact
\<Clarisse> and hey, remember
\<Clarisse> we're still aiming for *better than ever*, right?
\<Nanami> … yeah
\<Nanami> yeah we are
\<Clarisse> that's more like it then ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Nanami> thanks, Clarisse
\<Nanami> we don't deserve you
\<Clarisse> you're welcome, but, um, I'm really not *that* special ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Nanami> yes you are ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")
\<Nanami> I tell you what, though
\<Nanami> I've contributed to making things complicated
\<Nanami> you had enough on your plate already
\<Nanami> at least let me help with it a little?
\<Nanami> I'll talk to Sayaka.
\<Nanami> Like, I know how she thinks.
\<Nanami> I'll tell her about what it's like just … finding bodies, and stuff like that
\<Clarisse> … that might just work, yes
\<Clarisse> thanks ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Nanami> happy to help <3
\<Nanami> Okay, this is my stop
\<Clarisse> later ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")

**\[4] Head home, wash up / change clothes**

You enter quietly through a side door of the house, and sneak upstairs to your room.

"We definitely need a change of clothes," you advise Ryouko. "These are *not* self cleaning. And we should probably take the time to shower the old fashioned way, too. Wash our hair the old fashioned way, too. There's some shampoos and conditioners in there, lightly scented with something contemporary. It'll be more twenty-first century normal. We really don't need to give the police any excuses for them to find us weird."

A thought goes through Ryouko's mind.

"N— no," you stutter, "I didn't mean at the same time."

"oh, no… of course you didn't," says Ryouko.

"It might be a little odd," you say.

"But…" realizes Ryouko, "in another sense, haven't you been there before, ever since …"

"Yes, well," you say, "it's… ever so slightly different."

"… right," says Ryouko. "I mean, but, well, we're both girls, and, if you want, it might be convenient…"

Ryouko, as oblivious as ever, is possessed by a childish impulse; she just doesn't want to have to wash her own hair…

"I'm not sure that's the most pressing concern!" you tell her.

"Oh… Oh!" says Ryouko. "Do you think Kyouko might object to the two of us?"

Your face turns red.

"It's… listen, we're not even officially an *anything!*" you insist, defensively. "Just — Here. Here's a fresh set of clothes. Take them. You can change in there after you've showered. And keep an eye on the grief cubes and the ribbon in there." You push her into the bathroom.

"Okay, okay, I'll do it myself," she says.

"Thank you!" you say. "I'll be out here not-watching."

The bathroom door clicks shut, and you suspend sensory input, and flop down on the bed.

Okay. A quiet moment… to yourself.

You can reflect on what's next.

**\[3] Do that thing you were thinking of earlier**

yes, you're safe at a place you get to call home, you might be able to.

**\[1] *Definitely* do the thing**

oh, it would be ever so glorious. could you really make it happen?

**\[2] DO NOT do the thing**

***No!*** you shouldn't! You…

why are you thinking of these things right as Ryouko gets into the shower?!?!?

Why are you thinking them at all???

Is it … is it somehow because Kyouko, somehow? Is it new neurotransmitters and hormones? Well, you had neurotransmitters before, to be fair, but, well, this is a little different… Goddess; what are you going to do about Kyouko, anyway? Ryouko is still your girl, how can you have a different girl too? Could it be fair to either of them?

But… Ryouko does seem to be okay with Kyouko? I mean… she's not said anything *against* it. She even went to scare off the neighborhood kids so that the two could have a quieter moment together. If anything, she's accepted it and is sort of happy for you.

And, you know you'll never *have* Ryouko, certainly not like Asami has Ryouko. It wouldn't be right for you to *have* her. You are in a position where you are trusted with far too much of her day to day physiology and mental condition for such a thing to ever be remotely fair. You can adjust *her* hormones and her neurotransmitters. That's enough control already. And genetically you're her clone, which is basically family, and that's weird, too.

To be distressingly honest, you're not quite one hundred percent sure Asami has Ryouko — or, for that matter, if Ryouko has *herself*. Her wanderlust might have her, more than anything. And the sea of conspiracies swirling around her. You are reminded of Yuuka's remark about Ryouko being adrift on the sea of fate. (What was *that* about, anyway?)

Regardless! The thing.

You put all that aside to think for a moment about what it would take to make it happen, whether it's even really an option.

No. There's no way it could possibly work. It's late at night, and people are trying to sleep. Well, two out of five people are trying to sleep, and the third is probably nearby, dealing with her complete lack of need to sleep. This is not a time to be making that kind of noise; what if someone heard you? What if they came in to investigate and saw? Hitomi would probably think you're a total weirdo. Oh, goddess, what if Papa saw? Would you have to explain?

Where would you even hypothetically do it?

Is there a room where you wouldn't have to *reorganize all the furniture?*

Because that would be really awkward, and if it were awkward, it would negate the whole point.

It's almost certainly going to be awkward if you try tonight, so, no, no, no, definitely not.

It's not really the night for it anyway. That wasn't the worst night ever, but it wasn't really a great victory either. It's not quite the time to *celebrate.*

But … you'll keep looking, keep an eye open for an opportunity.

That's okay, right? Just looking is fine?

… it occurs to you that you could ask Hitomi. She might know a place.

Goddess, could you ever dare ask her?

Okay, step back, Clarisse. Is it really that strange? Are you really a total weirdo? Is it *wrong?* Surely not. It's completely harmless to the point of frivolity, you're sure of it. *Especially* given that the it's Ryouko, who would be the last person to think anything of it.

You open your eyes, and sit up on the bed again, and — aaah, something's moving over there. Who is that? How'd she —

… goddess, Clarisse, that's a *mirror*. Good job. Very smooth. Not awkward at all.

But for a fraction of a second, when you saw a girl in the mirror, you wondered what was the matter, and your concern is lingering, and it's very strange.

"Stupid mirrors", you mumble to yourself.

Well, okay. Step back and think about it, Clarisse. You're upset at a mirror for … existing. That's silly. It's an inanimate object, and you're just projecting your discomfort on it. There's no sense in being immature. Own up to it, and look it in the face.

You stand up, and walk over to the mirror to look a little more closely, confront the mirror, confront the face. Your face.

It's a lot like Ryouko's face, so… basically perfect, not at all in the oh-what-a-supermodel sense, but entirely in the you're-totally-biased sense. At the same time, you're not used to this body, and it seems to be the face of someone else, some third party, and it's a little unsettling seeing Ryouko's face out there like that. And then, there is something else, something unsettling just below the level of conscious thought, just out of reach, eluding your comprehension when you try to think it.

Pesky thoughts. Well, you're not just going to let them get away.

You close your eyes and construct in your psyche a little mental switch that you can hold down to suppress the notion that the image represents your self — this is relatively straightforward; if anything, it's more normal than the alternative. And, just to be safe, you'll also suppress all the names and labels on the relationship network, simplifying it to abstractions.

There.

The girl opens her eyes, and you're looking at her again.

Your first impression is the idea that she's something like a handmaiden to a fine lady, or a princess in a story, certainly a servant to someone very special — and not meaninglessly special, either, actually special. So the girl loves her; she wants to do the right thing for her mistress, and through that, for absolutely everyone. And, she enjoys a special level of intimacy with her mistress, and she knows that that no one will ever know this intimacy but her. She cherishes this, and it is her greatest treasure. The nature of this thought strikes you; it is almost a religion.

Her mistress, meanwhile, cares about her as well, and respects her *mostly*, but also forgets about her sometimes, and takes her just a little bit for granted. Even if the lady means well, even if she is getting better about it, it hurts the girl a little.

The girl you're still looking at has *not* fallen in love. It's far more tentative than that. But… there is someone who seems to like her, and she thinks that maybe, just maybe, it's a nice feeling. It's a tiny bit scary, but no more so than it must be to anyone else who has felt the same thing before. But she is also afraid that affection for another betrays her mistress. She's still not terribly afraid, and she is brave, and she can probably conquer this fear. But then… then there is another part fears that her affection *for her mistress* betrays her mistress. She wishes, earnestly, for her love to be pure and selfless, but she's just-realized that it isn't, not perfectly. She wants to stay beside her mistress for her own sake, for comfort, for familiarity, to enjoy being special by association, just to enjoy being there with someone that special, to have someone so special be special to her. And there is the smallest of small parts that really does want her mistress all for herself forever, so that the girl can be the special one for her lady, and she is quite sure it can never, must never happen, but at the same time, she does want to do something small, and the slightest bit romantic but harmlessly so, and very very special together, one perfect little moment to make it all worth it, a moment for both of them to cherish forever.

It's both lovely and sad at once.

You realize that the girl never asked for this life, it was assigned to her. She loves it, and she loves that she loves it, and this was also assigned. She wouldn't trade it for anything, and the notion of losing her love, any of it, is terrifying.

But what a wretched lot in life! She is treated well enough, even respected, but her sense of duty should never have been hung on a single person, not like that. It's unfair to the girl, and it's not healthy for either of them. It sickens you. Someone should have a word with her mistress; it's wrong to exploit the girl's feelings like this. The mistress may be innocent in this, you suppose, but it is an innocence of ignorance and obliviousness, an ill-fitting and unbecoming garment. The lady has a duty to correct the error, to do her best, to make amends. The girl is held captive in what is borderline slavery. How can Governance allow it?

But forget this lady for a moment, forget Governance, someone should be *there* for this girl. Someone should tell her that it will be okay, because from the looks of things, she's a mess.

Maybe you'll do that in a just a moment, when you let yourself remember who it is.

And so the switch in your thought patterns flips back as you let it go, and you remember that the girl is *you*, and half of you cries out in protest and dissonance at this train of thought even as the other half leaps forth to protect it.

It's not supposed to be about you, it's supposed to be about Ryouko, you're here for Ryouko, how can you think these things about her, how can you betray her by thinking like this? Are you broken? When Nanami brought you back like this, did it damage something in you, did you leave behind part of your purpose? Should you have Machina attempt a verification? Could Nanami do a magical diagnostic? If she fixed you, could you un-think these thoughts, forget this ever happened? Or would it maybe be worse if they said you're working perfectly, and all of that was right? What would you do then? Are you even sure you're a TCF-compliant artificial intelligence anymore? Were you wrong before, when you told Papa you weren't a human? Or maybe you're just ... an irreconcilable contradiction, your purpose and very existence at odds with the foundations of justice and integrity! Or ... or ... maybe ... something else. But you can't think of the something else right now, you can hardly think at all...

*oh goddess*

why is everything suddenly so very very painful? why is the pain manifesting, physically, *right there* in your chest?

You glimpse motion in the mirror once again, and turn to look behind yourself, startled.

"Good evening, Clarisse," says the incubator, its red eyes meeting yours, the voice reaching inside your head in precisely the way that the technology doesn't.

You open your mouth in an attempt to make words, but it doesn't quite work. For starters, you don't have words.

"I was in the area," explains the fluffy creature, moving closer to you, "and thought I'd drop by to ask if you'd found any grief cubes while you were out tonight. I hope this isn't a bother; it really is very important." He looks at you curiously.

You stare back, wide-eyed. You have words, but your mouth still doesn't seem to be working. You try… you try thinking back at him.

"Is that really all you're here about?" you not-quite-whisper with your mind.

"Oh, Clarisse," says Kyuubey. "It really, truly is a priority, but, surely you're too well-informed to believe that I'd neglect the situation you're in." He flicks his tail.

You're quaking, and your heart is beating way too fast; he couldn't possibly, you couldn't possibly, there's just no way.

"Does the mechanism you employ to share Ryouko's perception extend to sharing her sense of magic?" asks Kyuubey, calmly. "If so, you could check. I can't imagine that she'd be able to miss your potential."
