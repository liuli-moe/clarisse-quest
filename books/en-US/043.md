# Hero of Orpheus upbraids local teen with scathing verbal smackdown

The big winner here was plan PlanckConstant, with some snippets on individual sentiments from other plans.

**\[3] Share 2011-era protocols and drivers with Machina**

*Right*, you send. \*We've got a mesh network set up, because we're not sure if we can trust the local Internet. Here's the configuration files.

Really?\* asks Machina. \*Isn't that a little paranoid?

Not when there are middle school girls running around with the distillation of the twenty-fifth century's science in their heads. We really should assume the state-level actors are coming after us right now, so that we don't leave any evidence trails that could lead them to us once they actually take interest.

I take it back,\* replies Machina. \*Prudence is called for.

Here are protocol drivers for the interesting things. There's a long-range network for voice and data, but you need to pay for the data access separately, and it's metered. Short-range access isn't. The security on everything's a joke. You'll find analog radio bands —

Yes, I found those\*, she sends. \*Oh. This short-range wireless should be quite useful. I suspect they have a hidden camera around here somewhere; there's a little noise on the one frequency whenever there's motion.

Who has you there, the police? What's the situation?

Yes, we're somewhat detained. I'm not sure of the exact protocol. Mami woke up this morning in what I believe was the city morgue. \*Machina summarizes a day of questioning, fingerprinting, and medical tests, including some blood samples. She appears to have been put up in a rather bland apartment right now.

You worry about the blood samples a moment, then a tangential thought occurs to you.

*Machina,* you enquire, \*did you hear any of them talking as if they were missing another body as well?

They might have been!\* she exclaims. \*But then, why wouldn't you wake up here too? Oh, Ryouko must have teleported herself out, of course.

In her sleep?\* you ask.

*Well, where did you wake up?* she asks.

*Shizuki family house,* you tell her. \*A spare bedroom. Apparently we've been … magically adopted, or something.

You're settling in so quickly! \*she replies. \*Well, that's at home with family. This younger Mami doesn't have any other friends and family to stay with, the poor dear, and her apartment's in a bad way. Might that explain it?

I suppose. This whole wish feels like it was put together by a fourteen year old girl,\* you complain. \*It's a mess of inconsistent effects.

That doesn't make much sense for a simple resurrection wish,\* agrees Machina.

\*Well, \*you admit, *it might not have been quite as simple as a resurrection wish*. \*I fear that we might be expected to attend the local middle school with a group of friends.

Oh, goddess, Clarisse,\* she says. \*She's not in love with Ryouko, is she? Love wishes are a minefield.

I don't *think* so,\* you say. \*A little star-struck, perhaps, but her affections seem to lie elsewhere.

Well, praise the goddess, that's a small mercy,\* opines Machina\*. But it's a mess. We need Ryouko saving the future.\*

\[3] Ask why she spoke of the Goddesses afterlife as fact

*Speaking of the goddess, though,* you enquire, changing the topic, \*is there a particular reason you framed your remark about the afterlife in those terms? You were much more tentative the last time we discussed the topic.

Oh, \*she says. \*I'm not quite sure how much I ought to say; Mami's privacy is a consideration.

Did you finally get her to visit the Ribbon?\* you ask, surprised.

*It wasn't me,* she says.

\*Did *you* see the Goddess?

Sort of,\* says Machina. \*She was less misty and white than I expected, but she wouldn't let me see her face.

Did she give you advice?\* you asked.

Machina pauses for a moment.

*She told me to stop hiding from Mami,* she replies, with a twinge of guilt attached. You'd also told her to stop hiding from Mami, weeks before.

*Well,* you declare,\* you should probably stop hiding, then, shouldn't you?

At the moment, there are serious complications!\* objects Machina.

*Of course there are complications,* you tell her. \*Kyuubey in particular comes to mind. We might be slightly better off without him knowing you exist. Speaking of which, you should know — this universe apparently doesn't have demons or grief cubes. Well, *didn't* have them until a few days ago, anyway.

I see,\* replies Machina. *This version of Mami doesn't remember demons at all, she spends her nights hunting—*

The data stream is interrupted mid-sentence.

*Machina?* you ask.

*Oh, no,* she replies. *Oh no oh no oh no. Oh, this is really really bad. Oh geez this might just possibly be the worst ever. I'm not even sure I should say, that's how bad it is.*

Oh, goddess, indeed. How would she figure that out so quickly?

*If you're thinking what I'm thinking you're thinking, it's ever so slightly possible that Kyuubey might have already told us exactly where witches come from,* you inform her.

\*THAT MANIPULATIVE LYING RAT BASTARD, \*declares Machina. \*SHOOT HIM IN THE FACE, BOIL HIM IN SQUID ICHOR, AND GRIND HIS BONES TO MAKE BREAD.

I'm not sure he has bones, but I do have footage of Kyouko squeezing him until his head explodes, if that helps, \*you offer. \*You knew about witches already, back in the twenty-fifth century?

Only partly,\* she says, *through Akemi-San, of course*. *I've seen some of these images before, and there's a certain conversation which I shan't repeat, but she discussed the goddess saving magical girls from a terrible fate in slightly more detail than usual. Good goddess, what's happened to the goddess then??*

\[3] keep quiet about the goddess

You knew the name of the goddess back in the twenty-fifth century, but your instincts say to keep quiet about sharing it here and now.

*We're not sure what happened*, you hedge\*. Kyouko and Ryouko know about witches, in any event, and the others don't. Kyouko and Homura have seen grief cubes. Oh, and there's one more person from the future to watch out for: Simona del Mago. Watch out, she's an unknown quantity. She might be working with Oriko. \*You send her a few quick captures of Simona as a magical girl.

*She's that girl who was there when Ryouko made her wish!* exclaims Machina. \*How odd. When did she contract herself? What was her wish? There's not anyone else from the future, is there?

Not that we're aware of,\* you tell her. *Though if you should happen to encounter Asami, I'd have several fewer things to worry about.*

Machina is worried. \*The girl whose life Ryouko saved just before she contracted *also* travels back in time with her under mysterious circumstances? … Oh, goddess, she's not in love with Ryouko, is she?

Well, Kyouko reported that she's calling herself Shizuki Simona, which might just be a secret family connection, but also that she's obsessed with Ryouko and the fact that her soul gem is a star. So, I don't know. Do you call that love, properly, or is it more obsession?

… That's very very not good,\* declares Machina. *And I should have been notified if any of Ryouko's old classmates had contracted, it's standard for mentors, so her wish either must have been quite recent indeed, which could be bad, or she's been hiding it somehow, which would be worse. I wouldn't be surprised to find she's involved in this whole mess.*

\[3] keep quiet about the ribbon

\*That's a certainty, \*you admit, \*but the specifics of how exactly is quite uncertain.

We need to find her!\* insists Machina.

*I agree,* you tell her, \*but we've been busy finding everyone else so far, and if we find her she may alert Oriko that something's up. I'm not quite sure how we managed to avert Oriko's plans, but I'm reluctant to throw that away until we have to. We may have until early Friday morning; it seems she's expecting to meet the young Akemi-san after that.

Hmm, \*she replies. *Well, tight deadlines, that's nothing new\...*

***

Your conversation with Machina takes just seconds, and you send a quick update to Nanami, cc: Ryouko.

*It appears that one of the things your wish has decided to pull in from the future is twenty-fifth century Mami's tactical computer. She's a version two, like me, and her name is Machina. Nice girl, likes to make friends, but very very shy.*

Nanami sends confusion. \*Mami is alive in the twenty-fifth century? Is this some alternate timeline where she's born later or is she, like, four hundred years old?!?

The latter,\* you admit,\* and please don't mention it to her. We're going to try and ease her into this gently.

Should we come over too?\* asks Nanami.

*Best not to panic her with three magical girls at once,* you say.

*Okay,* says Nanami. \*I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then.

Calling it a night?\* you ask.

\*Homura's heading home, \*she says, \*and I might be stopping by the hospital to check on an idiot.

Ah, right,\* you reply. *Good luck with that.*

"So Mami's in a much better state than she was before," you tell Ryouko, "but we need to explain what happened and why Machina is in her head."

"What?" asks Ryouko. "Really?" The idea of explaining does *not* appeal to her at all. "Are you sure it's for the best to tell her?"

"Machina has been hiding from Mami for months," you explain. "The goddess herself told her she mustn't. And it'll be even worse now. She'll have no one to talk to and will be very, very lonely."

Ryouko spends a moment processing that further, surprised to hear that Machina had received such instructions, but also re-considering what "the goddess said so" really means.

"Please," you implore her. "If for no other reason, please, do it for me."

"… Okay," she says, and her mood brightens a little inside.

*Praise the goddess*, you think to yourself, and thank your girl.

"Oh!" she exclaims in surprise. "What is this?"

"It's called a hug," you explain.

***

\[3] Teleport close to Mami then via MG telepathy:
-\[3] Explain whats happened to Mami regarding Machina
-\[3] Explain that we will talk in proper detail when Mami isn't in jail

The teleport places the two of you outside a block away — Mami has been looking out the window, and Machina thinks it's likely safe from notice. This proves a reasonable concern, for the building seems like a normal enough low-rise apartment, but it's bristling with surveillance cameras, and has a high gain radio link on what seems to be a private frequency. You point these out to your girl, and highlight the unit that Mami is in — but she senses the soul already.

\*Mami-san, \*she sends, *thank goodness you're all right!*

Machina sends a message which you relay to your girl.\* She's surprised you're alive, and confused and afraid why you're concerned about her safety. On the one hand she's afraid you're working with Oriko, and if we're not, she doesn't know why you'd be willing to talk to her.

Listen,\* continues Ryouko, \*don't even worry about earlier, that was all Oriko's doing; she's trying to turn us all against each other. The important thing right now is to figure out how to get you out of there.

Who are you,\* replies Mami, \*and what are you doing in Mitakihara?

My name is Shizuki Ryouko. I'm staying with family. You might know Shizuki Hitomi, she's an underclassman. We're nice, I promise.

Who was that other magical girl with you?\* demands Mami. \*What were you all doing on the roof of the school?

She's a transfer student, Akemi Homura. She just started being a magical girl, and she blew her cover and mine. I was up there swearing everyone to secrecy.\*

She sends a quick clip of the scene, Akemi Homura telling everyone "I'm a magical girl, from the future!"

*Well,* sends Machina,\* that's one way to introduce Mami to future tech.

Do you have mind magic?\* asks Mami. \*I'll thank you to stay hands-off, as it were, and ask next time.

Oh, no,\* says Ryouko. *See, that's, um, the really awkward part. ***I'm*** a magical girl from the future. Much further in the future, actually. Twenty-fifth century. So, um, that's not even magic, that's just technology… um, sorry about that anyway, though…*

Mami is quiet a few more moments.

Ryouko worries that she's being really awkward and doing a terrible job explaining.

*That sounds incredibly dystopian,* says Mami, finally\*.

No!\* says Ryouko. \*It's really nice, I promise!

They say the exact same thing in all the brutal, repressive police states,\* retorts Mami. \*Just ask North Korea. How are your prison camps, in the future? Or do you just reprogram everyone to like it?

Okay, fine then,\* sends Ryouko, frustrated and feeling insulted.\* Call it a dystopia if you want, it doesn't really hurt me; the important thing is that Nanami, your underclassman, thought it sounded really nice, and didn't want her friends dying of old age and disease, and that what matters, because she was the one who made the wish that brought us both back from the dead, and you can complain to her about how the specifics weren't to your liking because four and a half centuries of biotech advancement offended your sense of aesthetics.\*

… Okay, that was really bad.

*Good goddess, Ryouko,* you tell her. \*Calm down!!! Mami's had a hard day. You're making it worse. You're supposed to be making friends here, not eviscerating her like the squid. And is that any way to speak to your senpai? \*You sort of understand where she's coming from; you like your future too — but this really isn't making it any easier for Machina, and you're upset at that.

*— I'm sorry,* she says, chastened. *That was out of line. Please, forgive me. I'm, um, I'm actually supposed to be making friends with everyone.*

There isn't an immediate reply.

*Mami?* asks Ryouko, tentatively.

*Mami is feeling very guilty right now,* sends Machina to you privately, \*because she's a very lonely girl indeed, but she's being very stubborn. I might be able to salvage this, if your girl can make just the slightest effort to, ah, keep it under control?

I'll try to manage her,\* you tell her.

***

"Well, the silver lining is that Machina isn't hiding anymore," you tell Ryouko.

She just leans up against a wall, stewing. "Mami started it," she says, lamely.

"Oh, I can just imagine the newsfeeds," you declare. "*Hero of Orpheus upbraids local teenage girl with scathing verbal smackdown, claims, 'she started it.'*"

"… that's not fair," she mutters, "I'm a teenage girl too."

"A famous one," you point out. "You're special. It comes with a price. People are going to pay attention to you, and hold you to a higher standard. You cannot do things like that."

She stews a bit, actively not-caring what other people think of her.

"Even if you don't care. It affects more people than you. Even right here here and now, if you transfer into Hitomi's class on Monday, the things you say and do will affect her reputation, and her family's reputation."

You're starting to get through, but she's being stubborn.

"*I'll* hold you to a higher standard," you tell her. "You hurt Mami and you hurt Machina."

She sighs.

"You did well to apologize," you allow. "And really, you're upset because you care. But you simply have to manage this sort of thing better. We *need* to fix that."

"Fix that?" asks Ryouko, confused. "How?"

"We'll be getting you a private coach, sooner or later," you inform her. "It was a *maybe* before, but definitely after that. Machina and I have been working on a shortlist, actually, since work on the movie started. Celebrity coaching."

"That's really a thing?" she asks, in discomfort and amazement.

"Of course that's really a thing," you tell her. "One of the MSY's many resources."

She squirms internally at the idea. "Can't I just be myself?"

"It's perfectly all right to just be Ryouko," you note, "but you should still make a conscious effort to understand what that means, and work hard to be the best Ryouko you can be, and help other people understand what that means."

"I don't think I'm really all that good at self-reflection," grumbles Ryouko.

"All the more reason to have a coach," you declare.

"Maybe," she says.

"And another thing, wormhole girl," you add. "One of these days, there's a real chance that you're going to make first contact with an alien species. I think we should all strongly prefer if that *doesn't* lead to another interspecies war."

"Okay okay," she says, chastened. "You're right. That would be really, really bad."

***

*I've told her that she doesn't have to deal with future tech any more than she wants,* sends Machina, \*but that it's really helpful when planning things out and keeping people safe. I also read her excerpts of the Governance manifestos, which helped a lot.

Just don't tell her she helped write some of them,\* you note. \*She'll feel old.

Of course not,\* concurs Machina. \*Do you think we can introduce her to everyone else at some point? I'm worried about dragging her too deeply down the technological rabbit hole at the moment. Establishing other people as people first should help.

We need to get her out of there first,\* you note. \*I think I understand, though.

Thank you ever so kindly,\* says Machina. \*We're still going to be in angst management mode for a while, but the soul gem is holding steady for the moment. I'll contact you if that changes.

Okay,\* says Ryouko. \*Should I apologize again?

Yes,\* you say, *and tell her that we should talk more in person when we get out.*

Ryouko makes more awkward apologies.

***

\[3] Ask what Mami has already said, keep her story consistent while working in our already planned narrative

Machina informs you that she's kept Mami to a nice, simple, "I don't know what was going on" story. This is fortunately consistent with Sayaka's story earlier, though without the embellishment where she suggested magical girls as an explanation. The real question is what they want to do with her, and whether Papa's lawyer can help get her out. Arranging for that sort of representation might involve more explanation than you planned on giving, though.

*We should talk with Papa when we get home,* Ryouko says.

*When we get home, it's going to be very late,* you note. \*And he's been traveling. He'll probably be asleep.

Oh,\* says Ryouko. That's going to take some getting used to for her.

Actually, it's likely to take some getting used to for the other girls, too. What are they up to? They're quiet. Really quiet. Suspiciously quiet. This merits an investigation.

\<Clarisse> Hey there.
\<Wakaba> Hey, what's up?
\<Clarisse> I'm just checking in on everyone. Started with you.
\<Clarisse> I just noticed that it's awfully quiet in that group chat.
\<Clarisse> Enough so that I don't have to make comments about professionalism to keep it clear for serious topics.
\<Clarisse> So while on the one hand, that's a good thing? I'm also a trifle worried.
\<Wakaba> I am unable to confirm or deny the existence of #fanclub at this time
\<Clarisse> Oh.
\<Wakaba> You are respectfully not invited ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Clarisse> Is that where everyone is talking?
\<Wakaba> Kind of. Hitomi's keeping to herself and I'm pretty sure Madoka decided to go to sleep a while ago.
\<Clarisse> I suppose this was inevitable.
\<Wakaba> Yeah I mean… you guys are super cool and all, but, like
\<Wakaba> Ryouko is a little bit scary
\<Wakaba> And now Nanami is suddenly all worried about really big serious things
\<Clarisse> Eminently understandable
\<Wakaba> And honestly you're pretty intense yourself
\<Clarisse> Huh.

You'd never considered yourself in those terms before.
Maybe you're not so good at introspection either.

\<Clarisse> Wakaba, I hereby appoint you Fanclub Liaison
\<Clarisse> let me know if there's a problem or someone needs help
\<Wakaba> Sure thing ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Wakaba> Do you want me to forward fanart, too?
\<Clarisse> You have fan art already?
\<Wakaba> It's mostly Yuuka
\<Wakaba> She was drawing Sayaka as a magical girl

\<Wakaba> \[sayaka.png]

This version of Sayaka has big white wings. It's a little off from how she was portrayed in the movies, but, it fits her well enough, you suppose. Besides the big wings, she sports an armored skirt (with little feathery wing designs on either side), and lots of gold trim everywhere.

\<Clarisse> That's a pretty nice costume.
\<Clarisse> You know, back in the twenty-fifth century, infiltrating Ryouko's fanclub was one of my duties.
\<Wakaba> hahaha
\<Clarisse> So I've seen a lot of fanart stuff, and this is pretty good. It's very Sayaka.
\<Wakaba> Yeah I want her to draw me, too, but she says she's not inspired
\<Clarisse> Well, anyway, thank you very much for letting me know.
\<Wakaba> Happy to help ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")

You're a little worried, though. The girls don't quite seem to be taking this seriously, and while governance policy on this would prefer you leave them to persist in their folly, it seems wrong to apply that when witches are a thing and governance and aliens aren't.

The time is now 3 AM.
You've been out in alleyways and labyrinths for a while now.
It might be time to take a step back and regroup before dealing with the police.
