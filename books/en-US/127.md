# the wretched refuse of your teeming shore

*Sometimes you have important things at work.*
*Sometimes you must travel for family.
Sometimes you have a crisis at home.*
*Sometimes the subject matter is hard to write about.*
\*Sometimes the story itself is hard to arrange satisfactorily.
Sometimes all of these and more.
\*
*When I say I'm sorry that I took so long, I understand someone will say "it's okay," but I did want it to not take so long.*

\[Aliens]\[3] Distract the alien xenobiologist with a chance to study humans (and maybe the cursed-trinket problem)
\[Aliens]\[2] Send Ryouko to investigate the landing site, with Simona and your guest.
\[Aliens]\[1] DO NOT have her attend class

You are struck with indecision on the matter. Perhaps you'll simply defer to Ryouko's judgment on this one.

\*I'll leave it up to you, \*you indicate, sending her a packet of instructions for intercontinental communications if she wants to head over there. \*It's not risk-free but I trust you to do a good job of staying out of trouble. \*Ryouko can easily evacuate from all but the most dire situations, and you would benefit from figuring out what those other aliens were up to sooner or later, and the aliens seem to have some interesting tools.

\[High schooler]\[4] (Ask Amy to lead him on for a bit to somewhere relatively public but quiet, where you can talk to him.)

You dispatch your instruction to Amy, who easily secures Araragi-san's attention by meowing at him.

He is compliant, but seems a little confused, and isn't making any more moves to capture Amy.

You find a quiet nook to arrive and approach him quietly.

"Excuse me," you ask, "but what would you say it is that you're doing here?"

He whirls about.

"Where did you come from?" he asks. "Why are you here?"

"... I'm walking to school," you say.

"School?"

"A big building with lots of classrooms?" you reply.

"Oh," he says, inspecting your uniform. "Right. It's morning, huh. You must live around here."

He's not looking very lively right now. "Have you gotten any sleep at all?" you ask.

He shrugs.

"I'd like to know what you're doing here yourself," you remind him. "I don't suppose this is your neighborhood."

He seems to be contemplating a response, when he receives a text message.

You listen to the signal carefully. Consistent with your previous experience, it seems to be delivered by a narrowly targeted radio beam, one which you might actually have some hope of tracing *if* Amy's data wasn't nonsense. The text message, according to Amy, is a fragment of a poem in English: "give me your tired, your poor / your huddled masses yearning to breathe free / the wretched refuse of your teeming shore." Your data indicate this to be part of the inscription on the pedestal of a notable contemporary statue. It's a step up from the prank calls, you suppose, but uninformative on its own. It's clearly a fiction; your own signal capture was too weak to produce anything coherent.

The high schooler reads the text, then grins a wide grin. "Nothing!" he says.

"I beg pardon?" you ask.

"Absolutely nothing. I made a wrong turn, and, it turns out I won't be needing these after all."

He tries to hand you the cat carrier.

"What?" you ask, stepping back.

"Please," he says. "It's for you. It's yours now. Please accept this gift."

"I don't need it," you object.

"Okay then," he says, and places the cat carrier on the sidewalk, and the can of cat food on top. "I'm going to catch up on sleep. Have a nice day!"

He jogs away from the scene, though he's not too fast about it.

You stare down at the unwanted cage, and shake your head. The nonsense you put up with…

"Oh hey Clarisse!" calls out a voice.

Kaname Madoka is heading your way and she seems somewhat excited about it.

"What's going on?" she asks. "Did you want to wait for Sayaka and walk to school together?"

"Oh, that would be nice," you say.

"Why do you have a cat box?" she asks.

"Well, that's a bit of a story," you tell her —

*Meow.*

That's not Amy. It's a lot more pathetic, desparate.

*Meow. Meow.*

Actually, if you're in this neighborhood, you're right next to the Akiyuki residence, and so that would probably be …

"Snowflake?" you say aloud.

*Meeeow.*

The cat seems to be inside the old lady's house. You enter through her gate and approach the front door cautiously, investigating. There is a notice posted on the front upon which the house a health hazard, entry to the structure is forbidden by the local authorities.

"Is she gone?" asks Madoka, reading the notice. Then her face goes white. "I hope she's not … d-d-"

"You looking for the old bat?" asks a neighbor, over the fence. "They finally hauled her off. Made an awful racket, I gotta say."

"Hauled her off?" you ask.

"Yeah. Took them long enough."

She goes on to describe some long running family dispute over the real estate, and whether or not they'll tear it down (which seems to be her primary concern), but you're missing some context and you are distracted by your own thoughts on the matter.

It makes a kind of sense. She's probably going to a shared facility. They take care of people, not pets. They might have people there with some allergies, weak immune systems, and sensitive health. And yet —

They didn't take the cat to an animal shelter. They didn't take it to be euthanized, as unfortunate as that might be. They didn't even let it out on the street. They just left Snowflake locked inside. The social services, who couldn't be bothered with a cat, came at your bidding. It was probably inevitable, but you were the proximate cause. They've taken away little old lady who can't care for herself, and are presumably doing a better job of that.

But… she didn't want to go.

And how good of a job can they be doing?

How much can they really care?

Madoka looks in at the kitty.

"I have a plan," she whispers to you.

***

Madoka rings her own doorbell, and you stand behind her with the carrier and a captured Snowflake.

Kaname Tomohisa soon answers the door in a work apron, holding a pair of gardening shears.

"Oh! Did you forget something?" he asks.

Madoka hugs his arm desperately.

"I'm sorry, Dad, I know I'm not supposed to, but this is an emergency, you see they took Mrs. Akiyuki to a home but they didn't do anything with Snowflake and now she has no home and no food and … and … can she stay just long enough to find one?"

This is the part in Madoka's plan where you speak up, and thus save the day.

"If it's not too much trouble, sir," you say. "For a little while?"

He turns to regard you with some interest.

"I don't believe we've met, but you must be Shizuki Clarisse," says Mr. Kaname. "Madoka has been telling us all about you."

"A pleasure to meet you, sir," you say, politely.

"Won't you come by this evening, Miss Shizuki?" he asks. "Snowflake can stay here until then, I'm sure."

"Oh," you say, "I suppose that I can, yes."

He smiles. "Let me put away my garden clippers and we'll see if we can find a place for her."

"Thanks, Clarisse," says Madoka, giving you a big hug.

You feel a little better for the moment, having saved the cat.

\[Hotel]\[4] Choose the extended stay hotel; it's more stable for Nanami.

You're keeping Nanami busy with some research on these latest discoveries, as a distraction from her current issues. You can't quite say you're distracting yourself with these hotel bookings, but at least they are straightforward.

You've almost stopped caring about the interloper and how the latest Interlope went down. Oh, certainly, you're getting tired of the sneaking around. If this mysterious interloper is really quasi-benevolent, she ought to quit being evasive and actually come talk to you in person, because you're tired of this.

But you're bothered by many things, like Nanami's shutdown attempt, and the thought of confronting the culprit and just asking for the whole plan right there leaves you feeling uncomfortably exposed. Normally you'd think of yourself as a bastion of information security, but if Nanami really wanted to read all your deepest secrets you're not sure how many she'd miss, and on top of that, there's someone or something out who has been hacking things in a way even she can't detect. Yes, come talk to Clarisse so that all your secrets are exposed!

… Assuming, of course, that the hacker isn't already working as that team's information security *anyway*.

You ponder this a while, as a distraction from the Snowflake incident. You do kind of have the feeling the interloper is working with Oriko somehow. At first, this was just the pessimistic worst-case situation in a hypothetical sense, but on further thought the whole episode feels just like the sort of mysterious fetch-quest she'd arrange. If someone can hack much of your tech, they could be communicating with her via phone while her guard is down — perhaps while you were distracting Kyouko, for instance. Oriko calling from a landline phone could have escaped your notice, and the rest of your monitoring programmed to silence it. You haven't sorted out all her cryptic comments on the matter, but the general premise is seeming more and more likely.

You're almost glad to have the kind of protection that looks out for the kitty, or Mrs. Akiyuki. It's just that you don't trust any of it any further than you can throw Oriko's soul.

\*Your new residence, \*you send to Nanami, \*while we work out something more long-term. Check-in is after 3pm.

Great. Do you want the bad news first, or the good news? \*replies Nanami.

*Either way*, you reply.

*I have results on your little old lady, *she sends*. Now, in the first records I found, she was supposed to go to an elder care facility a few kilometers outside of town. But their systems don't have her registered. I thought, maybe their database is garbage like their security, and they're just slow about paperwork. But then, I see a few recent transfers out to this Mount Obasuteyama facility, over in Sankyo, and I get curious. Sure enough, Ms. Akiyuki shows up.*

That much seems good news. *And the bad news?* you ask.

*Well, she's been prescribed triflupromazine and chlordiazepoxide.*

These aren't common in Governance, so you consult some reference materials.

*A sedative and an antipsychotic?* you reply.

\*The antipsychotic has side effects that include sedation, \*Nanami notes.

You're not trained in this kind of medicine at all, but it doesn't seem right.

*Isn't she a little old to be prescribed something where the side effects include difficulty balancing when she stands up? That would put her at increased risk of injury.*

Nanami raises an important counterpoint.\* At these doses, I'm not sure if she's going to be standing up at all.\*

Her neighbor said she didn't want to leave.

If she put up a big fight, would they sedate her for that?

Would the authorities, the ones entrusted with the elderly, the vulnerable and defenseless — the same ones who couldn't be bothered to let a cat outside — would they drug a little old lady into submission because she's making too much noise and doesn't want to go?

*It looks like most of the hospital's drugged up on things like this*, Nanami notes.

You look at the data, incredulous.

Even in the twenty first century… how? Maybe you could see it in some discount corner cutting for-profit elder home in America, if you imagine it run by some cartoonish villain with a curly mustache, but … this is Japan, and respect for one's elders is supposed to be part of the culture.

The authorities are supposed to help people, damn it.

\*How is something like this **allowed** to happen here? \*you want to know.

*Demographics,* explains Machina, coolly. *Twenty percent of the country is over 65, and they're on trend to hit twice that. They've prepared for it for decades, and it's not enough. But the economy is mediocre, and there's already resentment from the younger generations on spending so much on the elderly. You could blame individual people, but it's pretty hard to hold off the pressures of that kind of system all by yourself. The result is corner-cutting, and letting people just fall through the cracks. Nothing will fundamentally change, not any time soon.*

It's as simple as that.

As bloodless as that.

And **it can't be helped**, There's nobody to blame for it all except **everybody**.

\*That kind of facility is going to be witch bait, \*Machina adds. *It's likely at the heart of another team's territory. Visiting would be a major provocation; don't go without a plan.*

Then a little subprocess looking through the prescription records flags another record for your attention. Shiina Hikaru, dosed with risperidone, another antipsychotic with sedative side effects, indicated for "schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability caused by autism." She's younger than most of the patients, and has been at the hospital for at least a year.

*Is that Yuuka's mother?* you ask Nanami, incredulous.

*I don't want to answer that*, she replies, with several ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(") sentiments attached.

Before you can find the words or even the feelings to properly react to this latest development you are interrupted by a commotion at the door.

"Excuse me," says Ms. Valentin. "I was hoping to speak with Shizuki Clarisse."

***

"It looks like I have you to myself today," says Ms. Valentin, settling down. "You seem on edge. Please, have some tea."

You *are* on edge, and the architecture of the place isn't exactly doing anything to comfort you. It's a little too austere, and big, and a bit ominous.

A tea tray sits on the table at the center of the circle. You sit down across from Ms. Valentin and pour a cup, if only to appease her.

"It's not uncommon to struggle with finding a purpose, or change your mind," says Ms. Valentin. "I thought today I'd discuss the matter in the context of your friends."

She presses a button on a small remote control device, and some documentation appears on the monitors on her wall; career profiles, with various information.

"I was speaking with Kaname-san recently," says Ms. Valentin. "She said that she wanted to be a veterinarian, and help animals. But then, she thought that maybe she should be a doctor, and help people. And then she thought maybe she should be a medical researcher, to help lots of people. But it's not the same, because you're not as close to the people. It's important to her to be hands-on." She gazes over at a chart that estimates the number of patients various sorts of doctors are expected interact with. "That's a difficult trade-off. The path that does the most good may not be the path that leaves you feeling like you did the most good."

You nod, distractedly.

"Now, Miki-san, she's also hands on; she wants to go into 'international relations' but if you ask me, she has a long way to go if she really wants to be a spy." The charts here are less informative, apologizing for the specifics being classified information.

"A spy?" you ask.

"Oh, yes. Quite the imagination, that girl. She proposed martial arts training as part of an extended curriculum. I approved it, of course."

She's not wrong, of course, but you're also starting to wonder at double meanings, if this is Valentin tipping her hand in some fashion.

Ms. Valentin switches to a ballet related set of charts, aspirational images juxtaposed with a long-tail earnings profile featuring high dropout rates and an early end to the career.

"The thing which I didn't quite understand is, why did you think that ballet would a good idea in the first place?" she asks. "Yes, there's a family connection, and it could be a safe thing to say. Or maybe you imagine you would gain your father's favor. But with all your potential…"

She pauses, and you frown. Talking about "potential" is a little too on the nose, isn't it?

"Clarisse," she asks, "do you desire power for its own sake?"

You blink at her, and try your best to reason about how this could possibly follow, if this isn't about magical girls somehow.

"What?" you ask aloud. "No."

She laughs.

"Oh, no, of course not," says Ms. Valentin. "You desire power to protect the ones you care for. But then you see this unforgivable world, in all its brokenness, and it's simply too much. It hurts the ones you love — and worse. You fear it degrades them, for you to put them first, to put their well-being ahead of justice."

You haven't shared that. She hasn't nailed it perfectly, but she knows too much about how you've been thinking about the problem of the Star Princess. How?

"Who are you?" you ask. You're not frightened for your safety, but that was far too deep into your own thoughts. There's \*no way \*that she isn't up to something.

"Oh, the two of us are quite alike," Valentin continues, blithely. "But I'm not quite a systems thinker in the end, the way you are."

You try a shot in the dark. Simona thought that Valentin was a disguise for Akemi Homura, and it seems to fit her. You might as well try and confront her.

"Akemi-san," you begin — but you are interrupted.

"Yes, Akemi-san!" Ms. Valentin beams with delight. "She is thriving. She has found strength, but has not been destroyed with cynicism. She has friends, and a darling little crush, which is not yet an obsession. Perhaps she even has a *chance*. Ah, whatever might she do with herself?"

...

You are as confused as ever. This wasn't the sort of reaction you'd expected at all.

"I don't even know what level this conversation is on anymore," you tell her.

"Oh, we're discussing vocations. As we always have been," says Ms. Valentin, with a smug grin. "Your case is simply somewhat more interesting than usual."

You shake your head, and sip at your cup of tea performatively.

"You know, Clarisse, if you wished it," says Ms. Valentin, "you could be the god of this world."

"I beg your pardon?" you say, carefully pausing your sip.

"It would be quite simple, of course," says Ms. Valentin.

A familiar and unwelcome voice calls out from the shadows.

"Make a contract with me, Clarisse!" says Kyuubey, emerging into the light, and bounding over to Ms. Valentin's lap. "I am more than willing to negotiate."

"Who are you?" you ask Ms. Valentin again. "Really."

"I thought you *wanted* to talk, Clarisse," she says, with a smile. "All right. I'm tipping my hand plenty as it is, but if you must, the name you don't know and won't have any reason to use is Higanbana," she says. "But just 'Ms. Valentin' will do for now, if you please."

***

**> make a contract, and become the god of this world!!**

Ms. Valentin, I regret, is unlikely to shower you with information and cooperation. Rather, she is carefully selecting what she tells you, and certainly protecting secrets of her own. If you can figure any of them out, it might strengthen your position!
