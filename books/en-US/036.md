# can we be the Gang of Nice instead?

**\[5] Hug Kyouko**
\[2] Hug Ryouko too
\[2] Admit this is a horrible revelation to us as well
\[1] Reassure Kyouko by telling her you're from a future where it's not like that.
\[1] Explain the future where it's not like that

You lean over and squeeze your Ryouko.

"It's going to be okay," you tell her.

"Thanks," she says, replacing her scowl with a small smile. "I hope so."

"Right," you say, as you let her go, then look over to Kyouko. "You too!"

"W— what?!" she says, as you slide out of the booth.

"It's going to be okay," you repeat, leaning into the booth and stretching your arms around her.

She just sort of looks at you, and then across the table to Ryouko, and then back at you, and blushes.

"H— how do you know that? You don't know that."

"This is a shock and dismay to us, as well," you say, "but we do know that it doesn't have to be this way."

"How do you — wait, like, you know from the future??" asks Kyouko.

"No comment," you declare.

"Clarisse," says Ryouko, "how do we fix this?"

"Well," you say, letting go of Kyouko, "the first step is straightforward, just work very hard at *not dying*. Pure soul gem, no problem, right? Conserve the magic, treat every ounce it with respect."

"But he just \*told \*us that the population isn't self-sustaining," says Ryouko, "so we still have to kill — oh! Oh no."

You follow her thoughts forward. "You think *Oriko* is trying to fix this?"

"What else would she want with used grief cubes?" asks Ryouko. "It's not like she needs to set a trap and kill anyone *stealthily*. She wants them to self-replicate! Her message for Homura-chan said as much too!"

"Hold on," interrupts Kyouko, "what are you two going on about?"

You sigh. "The theory is that Oriko is already trying to fix the system, and Kyuubey is trying to get us to stop it. But because Oriko's *psychotic,* all her plans for fixing things involve turning people against each other, and *murder*, so it's not like joining her side is an attractive option either, let alone *safe*."

"Let's make a new side," says Ryouko. "We can't let ourselves be defined by Kyuubey and Oriko's schemes. Let's build a support organization for magical girls where we don't try to kill each other, and work together instead. If it *really* takes off, we can even try to make the world a better place."

Kyouko tilts her head. "That's an awfully pretentious way to put it. How many magical girls would you have to start? Two?"

"Four," says Ryouko, "five if we can find Mami and have her join, and, well, there's the others."

"What 'others?'" asks Kyouko.

"It's, ah, a delicate matter," you say. "There were several girls caught up in someone's wish. Not magical girls, but given what we just learned about the grief seed situation, that's probably just as well. Actually," you note, "you could say I'm one of them too."

"I see." Kyouko leans back. "But, you know, I'm not really much of a team player. Not sure how well I'd fit in."

**\[5] Ask if Kyouko would like to join The Gang™**

"How about just provisionally, then," you offer, "while we figure out things like how to find Mami, and what to do about Oriko?"

She tilts her head to the side. "Hmmmmmmaybe. Yeah, okay. I suppose I can help you out for that much. Unofficial-like."

"Excellent," you say. "Okay, down to business. First thing — Kyouko, do you have a cell phone?"

Ryouko and Kyouko exchange numbers.

**\[4] Make sure Kyouko has a place to stay**

"Number two," you say, "do you have a safe place to stay? I don't want to drag you into any unwanted commitments after Oriko, but if you're sleeping under a bridge somewhere —"

"Don't worry about it," she interrupts, "I got a real sweet hotel room."

"… legally?" you ask, with a worried look.

"Nope," she says, with a big grin.

You frown. She wasn't all that big on accepting help in this era, was she?

**\[5] Discuss goals and objectives with The Gang™**

"Right," you say, "that's … *probably* dangerous in the long term, but, if you insist, I can't blame you for guarding your independence… Next concern, then, is to prioritize our goals and objectives."

"We want to find Mami," says Ryouko, "figure out what to do about Oriko, and Kyuubey, and … Simona," she says.

"While dealing with the police investigation," you add. "Though that's a little more reactive."

"Plus, we need to keep hunting witches," says Ryouko. "We need all the reserves we can get, in case Oriko tries to starve us out. And, at some point we should try to train Homura-chan."

"… that poor pathetic mouse?" asks Kyouko. "*She's* one of the four?" She looks ostentatiously unimpressed.

"Homura's magic is probably more powerful than everyone else's put together," you tell Kyouko.

"… huh?!!" asks Kyouko.

"This is why Oriko didn't want her teaming up with anyone," you point out.

"That's right," says Ryouko, "and I think that's the main thing. If we have to go up against Oriko, we should do it from a position of strength, so she has as few choices and as few opportunities to defeat us as possible. The more we can do that, the more we neutralize her primary power. So, we should try to find Mami as soon as we can."

*I see*, you tell your girl. *And that helps gets Kyouko on board as well.*

"How?" asks Kyouko.

You frown. "Actually," you say, "if I'm right, and a wish brought her back from death, there might be a way to find her rather quickly. It's just ... risky." You have a mesh network now. You could use all the girls to look for someone who has governance implants. The main problem is that it's not super high power, it's very directional. Maybe if you could hijack a well-positioned antenna. But then…

"Simona might notice," says Ryouko.

You nod. "And if she's working with Oriko, then Oriko might notice her." *And she'll freak out,* you note.
\*
If she hasn't already,\* notes Ryouko.

"You guys got some sort of freaky spell?" asks Kyouko, pointing the two of you.

"We have freaky *technology*," says Ryouko.

"Hold on, I'm going to talk to the others," you say, "and think about whether this is even feasible, first."

"If that doesn't work," Ryouko asks Kyouko, "where should we look for Mami?"

Kyouko begins to explain Mami's witch-hunting strategies.

**\[4] Explain to The Gang™ that Kyuubey can't be trusted**
\[1] Give him a chance
(hahahahahahhahahahahaa)
\[-1] Explain witches to everyone

\<Clarisse> Okay, update. We found Kyouko and have convinced her to join our side, at least for now.
\<Clarisse> Also, we've sort of decided that we're a side now.
\<Clarisse> I hope this is okay with everyone; we've sort of been one, informally, since the rooftop.
\<Nanami> woo! magical girls represent!
\<Clarisse> Actually, the magical girls are outnumbered at this point.
\<Sayaka> technological girls represent ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")
\<Sayaka> we need a clever name!
\<Wakaba> the Gang of Nine
\<Wakaba> or are we officially ten?
\<Yuuka> can we be the Gang of Nice instead?
\<Madoka> !!!
\<Madoka> i like it!
\<Nanami> doesn't sound very serious ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")
\<Sayaka> anyway, I thought you said Kyouko was dangerous?
\<Clarisse> Well, it's a long story.
\<Clarisse> She was working for Oriko because she was dangerously low on grief seeds.
\<Clarisse> We suspect Oriko used future sight to find the witches first, and steal all the grief seeds.
\<Clarisse> So the three of us saw what Oriko did to Mami's apartment — another long story
\<Clarisse> but Mami used to be Kyouko's senpai
\<Clarisse> suffice it to say, Kyouko's had a change of heart
\<Madoka> so we can be friends? <3
\<Clarisse> Provisionally, at least.
\<Clarisse> She's a little afraid to commit after being used by Oriko like that.
\<Madoka> oh, that's sad. ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(")
\<Clarisse> The real trouble is Kyuubey.
\<Nanami> What? How's the fluffy fuzzball *trouble*?
\<Clarisse> so, Kyuubey came to us, asking for our help taking down Oriko.
\<Clarisse> This was exactly what we were talking about doing moments before.
\<Clarisse> Except when he made his pitch, it was full of manipulative lies.
\<Wakaba> ?? like how?
\<Clarisse> Well, he was giving us reasons to help take down Oriko
\<Clarisse> and asked him about what a certain something does, and he said, "think of it as a weapon."
\<Clarisse> He didn't *say* it was a weapon, he said to *think* of it as a weapon. Future-secrets: *it's not a weapon*.
\<Ryouko> What Clarisse said. It was pretty bad.
\<Ryouko> (Carry on; I'm busy talking.)
\<Clarisse> This was disturbing, but then we got him to come out and admit several *other* ugly secrets he's been keeping from *all* the magical girls.
\<Clarisse> So Kyouko got mad at him, and literally squeezed him to death
\<Madoka> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
\<Madoka> ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(") ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(") ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(") ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(") ![:(](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Frown    :(")
\<Clarisse> *he came back with another body after about ten seconds*
\<Clarisse> and then proceeded to eat the corpse of the one that she had just killed
\<Nanami> *Nani?!?*
\<Sayaka> zomgwtf?!
\<Clarisse> I'll spare you the graphic footage.
\<Clarisse> So we've thought about it, and Ryouko thinks that Oriko is actually trying to do something good, she's just trying to do it with manipulation and murder. Unfortunately, this is exactly what we'd expect of her, given what we know of her from the future. Which means she's definitely not one of the good guys, *but* it might still be a bad idea to fight her anyway.
\<Clarisse> … We're working on it.
\<Clarisse> We think the key for now is to keep building our alliance
\<Clarisse> Then we can face Oriko from a position of strength
\<Clarisse> Whether that's fighting her or just negotiating
\<Clarisse> So the next thing to do is find Mami-san, if she's alive.
\<Clarisse> And the more I think of it, the more likely it is that she's back
\<Clarisse> *That* means that she probably has future technology implants too.
\<Nanami> You want to just try to find her over the radio?
\<Clarisse> Maybe, but the other piece of news is *Simona*.
\<Clarisse> Kyouko tells us he's been hanging out with Oriko.
\<Clarisse> and we're not sure if she's been working with Oriko, too.
\<Clarisse> If we go looking for Mami with future signal protocols, she might notice.
\<Clarisse> And if she notices, she might tell Oriko, or Oriko might notice it anyway too.
\<Nanami> fuckity fuckfuckfuck, fuck
\<Nanami> Clarisse, darling ./\~
\<Clarisse> … yes? :S
\<Nanami> you know how we have all these copies of *Intro to FutureTech for Middle School Girls* lying around?
\<Nanami> when the girl with future vision sees what sort of havoc that plays with the future…
\<Nanami> what do you think that scream sounds like?
\<Clarisse> … *I don't know*
\<Sayaka> ehhhh that does not sound good
\<Nanami> Might there possibly maybe be any way to go looking for her which *doesn't* threaten to involve Oriko?
\<Wakaba> oh, guys, guys, i just realized
\<Wakaba> you know who \*else \*has been looking for Mami?
\<Wakaba> the Mitakihara Police Major Case Squad
\<Nanami> fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffuuu
\<Wakaba> want to bet she's in a holding cell
\<Sayaka> … omgwtf are we going to bust someone out of jail??!
\<Clarisse> NO! THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA!
\<Wakaba> we're not even sure she's there
\<Nanami> remain calm
\<Nanami> do not make any sudden moves
\<Clarisse> Right.
\<Clarisse> I'll call Homura next, and warn her about Kyuubey.
\<Clarisse> and … where's Hitomi?
\<Hitomi> (autoreply) I'm ever so sorry, but I've placed this chat in silent mode, so that I can have some quiet time.
\<Clarisse> … that's *probably* fine
\<Madoka> hey Clarisse
\<Madoka> you sound like you're \*really \*busy over there!
\<Clarisse> A little bit, yes.
\<Madoka> I can call Homura if you'd like? ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Madoka> It's no problem, I'd be glad to help! <3
\<Clarisse> … okay, that could work

It's less direct, but you figure if it's coming from Madoka, she'll be sure to listen.

\<Clarisse> just don't use any text messages, okay? It's not safe.
\<Madoka> Okay, I won't.

"… Which is one of the reasons I hang around in a place like this," says Kyouko. "Especially late nights. Why go hunting when the prey just comes to you? Of course, Mami's too much of an ojou-sama to be caught dead around a place like this. I was surprised you two were up for it, honestly."

Ryouko nods. "It doesn't quite fit her image," she says.

"But anyway, the point is, she's a witch hunting *machine*, and I'd be checking out the high probability witch spots," Kyouko concludes.

**> hunt for senpai**

\[ ] Check out witch-heavy territories on foot
\[ ] Case out the local police stations, jails

Anything other scheming while we're at it?
Got any other brainstorming ideas about what to do about Oriko?
