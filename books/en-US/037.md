# I am the batman

(Apologies for the delays! We got a late start on consensus on this one, and it's a tricky update!)

… "But anyway, the point is, she's a witch hunting *machine*, and I'd be checking out the high probability witch spots," Kyouko concludes.

**\[6] Combined patrol and electronic search, passing near police stations**
\[1] (+2 -1) High power wide-area broadcasts

You lean back in your seat, contemplating. "We have our own ways to look for Mami," you say, "but employing them as part of a patrol would make a lot of sense. And we have two more girls who can help."

"Four girls hunting for the same witches?" says Kyouko. She shakes her head. "That's a waste."

"Okay, then," you say, "how about two groups? Nanami would be able to use this technique as well, and we can contact one another if there's trouble."

"That makes sense!" says Ryouko. "We should put Homura with Nanami; then both groups will have mobility, firepower, and long range comms."

You nod. "And hopefully that means Homura makes a friend, too."

"What *is* this special technique, anyway?" asks Kyouko.

You make a face. "I'd *prefer* not to go into detail, but… it involves the incidental properties of someone else's wish, it wouldn't work on most people, but it would work to find Mami-san."

Kyouko frowns briefly, but then shrugs it off. "All right," she says.

"Why don't we just try to search the entire city at once?" asks Ryouko, beginning to consider the logistics of how to make that happen.

"Because Simona might notice," you note, "and that means Oriko might notice, and I'd prefer that she doesn't notice anything. Not yet, anyway."

"Oh. Of course," replies Ryouko.

"So, if Mami's status is unknown, and Kyouko is just visiting, that leaves Ryouko as the most senior magical girl. That said, Kyouko is the local expert, and might be the toughest. How should we structure the chain of command here?"

Kyouko looks at you like you have two heads. "*Chain of command?* Is this a thing you guys do?"

"It's *combat*," you say. "If we're fighting about who's in charge *during actual combat*, we're dead."

She shakes her head. "Whatever, it just sounds like you're in the army or something."

"Captain, actually," says Ryouko, "not that it means anything here …"

"What." declares Kyouko.

Managing Miss Not-A-Team-Player will require some measure of diplomatics, you fear.

"We're not making an army," you declare, "we just need an understanding for the moment. Everything will change if we find Mami anyway." You take a breath. "So, I'd propose that *in group combat*, Kyouko sets our tactical priorities, since she'll know what to expect, and Ryouko's responsible for making everything happen." Which should leave Ryouko in charge, but will hopefully keep Kyouko happy too. "Outside of combat, we talk to each other and work on consensus."

"Ehh," says Kyouko. "Sure, whatever. Sounds fine."

"We'll invite the others, then," you say, "and meet up here to introduce each other. While we wait, we can plan patrols."

\[2] put tacnet into stealth mode
\[1] AT SOME POINT check what tech people have properly

You call up Homura and Nanami, both of whom are happy to join you, and send around a quick settings update, to activate a stealthier mode of operation for your mesh network and to extract a technology inventory. The girls seem to be running a Governance firmware version 2011.04a, release codename "Nanami's Wish," which is informative but unhelpful; inspecting the superficial manifest, it appears to be a civilian package as far as the physical implants and nanites are concerned, but with a custom set of what appear to be unrestricted drivers. From the absence of several modules, you suspect that there is nothing here, for instance, to prevent any of the girls from going into a VR fantasy land forever, performing strange body modifications on herself, or preventing mind-to-mind file transfers.

You should probably discuss this matter with Nanami at some point, but later.

***

"Ah! There you are!" says Nanami, bounding towards the three of you. "Hello hello!"

Kyouko has gotten bored, and is playing a round on the \*Dog Drug Reinforcement \*machine to help take her mind off witches.

Homura-chan is a few steps behind Nanami, approaching nervously.

"Hey again, pigtails," says Kyouko, not turning around. "Looks like your friends found you, huh?"

"Oy. No thanks to *you*," declares Nanami. "What were you trying to do, anyway? Terrorizing a poor innocent girl."

"Terrorizing!" exclaims Kyouko, launching into a section of difficult footwork. "If she's gonna be terrorized by a little nothing like that, I hate to think what happens when you put her in a labyrinth."

"f-f-… for your information," says Homura, "I've been in *multiple* labyrinths\* —\*"

"Yeah?" says Kyouko. "How many of them as *witch-bait?*"

"As — h-hey!" she exclaims. "That's…"

"Wow, talk about rude," says Nanami.

"I just call it — *uhf* — like I see it," says Kyouko, still intent on her score. "Streets out there are tough, not everyone's going to be as understanding and as friendly as I am."

"That — That wasn't friendly at all!" exclaims Homura.

Nanami scowls.

You sigh. You suppose you could ask her to be nice, but she'd probably push back. Maybe instead …

"Come on, Kyouko," you say. "Be serious. You can flirt with them another time."

Kyouko stumbles, and misses a step, ending her 400-step combo streak.

"W-what?!? I'm not …"

"Sure you're not," you declare.

"Reeeeaaaaallllly," says Nanami, raising an eyebrow.

"W-whatever!" says Kyouko, turning her back.

"Getting back to business," you say, "Nakamura Namami, Akemi Homura, meet Sakura Kyouko," you declare. "Nanami enjoys putting holes in things at high velocity. Homura can supply… stealth, and literally infinite speed. Sakura-san enjoys impaling things with her spear, and also cares about food waste and the well being of small black stray kittens."

Kyouko spins back around. "Aha! I knew someone was watching!" she declares.

"I believe her exact words were, quote, *Don't abuse cats, I'll kill you if you do,*" adds Ryouko.

"Well," says Nanami, "it's true that she protected Amy, so she can't be all bad."

"… You named the cat Amy?" says Kyouko.

Homura nod-nod-nods. "Amy's the best cat in the whole world," she says with quiet conviction. "If you — if you helped keep her safe, then I ... I owe you a debt of gratitude." She bows.

"Aw, geez, kiddo," she says, leaning onto the rail and ignoring the screen as her dance game finishes with a mere 74% score. "It wasn't anything special or nothin' like that."

"It is!" exclaims Homura, straightening up. "There's a — There are girls out there who would make a wish with Kyuubey to save her, okay??!?"

"What?" says Kyouko. "Now *that's* an idiotic —"

"Kyouko." you interrupt, loudly. "Please. I would prevail upon you most strongly to let this matter go. It is deeper than you appreciate."

"Right, no bullying our little Homu," declares Nanami, stepping over to give the girl a showily protective hug. "That's my job."

Homura seems a little surprised.

"Hmmph," remarks Kyouko. "Fine."

"Thank you," you reply, sweetly.

***

After a few more minutes during which no one tries to kill each other, you seem to have things mostly hashed out, and everyone has a good idea of where they should be going.

"We're playing a numbers game here," you tell Nanami and Homura, "a long one. Risk aversion is the name of the game. If you have a 90% chance to win against a witch, then after seven witches you're more likely to be dead than alive. A 95% chance gets you to about 14 witches. At a 99% chance, and we're still only talking 70 witches or so. So you can take this seriously, and there's no reason you can't live forever, or *don't*, and you can expect to die before your sixteenth birthday."

Homura swallows, and looks nervous. Nanami seems thoughtful.

"This is one reason why Homura is such a valuable asset," you continue. "She can be a Get Out Of Trouble card. Even if she does nothing most of the time, she is an excellent form of insurance, and when things get rough, she can get us out of there. If Homura is present, your top tactical priority is to preserve her mobility, so that she can preserve everyone else. Beware entangling things, ribbons and vines and the like." Those weren't fun at all.

Nanami nods. "So if we actually find a witch," she says, "we should probably phone it in to you, and then decide what to do from there?"

"Yes," you say. "Also, if you find something that's *not* a witch."

"Yeah, that's another thing," interrupts Kyouko. "Don't go and try to fight familiars before they turn into full-fledged witches. That's a trap that gets rookies."

"Huh," says Nanami. "I would have thought that it's easier when they're weaker."

"It is. It's also a total waste of magic," says Kyouko. "It's totally unsustainable."

"How about when we've saved up a lot of grief seeds, then?" asks Nanami.

Kyouko sighs, and closes her eyes.

"The king of Egypt had a dream," she recites; "he was standing on the banks of the Nile, when out of the river came seven cows, fat and sleek. And the cows grazed there happily among the reeds." She opens her eyes as she goes on. "Afterwards out of the river came seven skinny cows, all skin and bones, ugly and diseased, with festering wounds and open sores infested by maggots." She leans in towards Nanami with a big grin. "And the seven skinny cows devoured the happy cows, and ate them whole."

Homura stares with wide eyes. Nanami looks confused.

"… holy Genesis, Kyouko," you observe, "I don't recall there being *maggot-infested wounds* in my copy of that text."

She shrugs, and points to her head. "Goin' off memory here."

"I don't get it," says Nanami, folding her arms.

"After the feast comes the famine?" summarizes Ryouko.

*You should be able to look it up*, you message her. It's a lot more pedestrian than the Mandatory Session materials, that's for sure.

*Oh! You're right!* she remarks.

"I understand," says a pliant Homura.

"Fighting familiars is completely unsustainable," declares Kyouko. "Just *don't.* If you're going into a labyrinth and they're in your way, that's one thing, but if you can save magic by avoiding them, do that instead."

"This is a fine point," you allow, "but I was actually thinking of the event that you run into something else, a new danger: not a witch, not a familiar, not even in a labyrinth. Anything out of the ordinary like that, stay back, do not engage, call the group immediately. If you find you\* can't\* call, run until you're clear, and *then* call. We tackle something like that together, okay?"

You turn to look at Kyouko, who seems surprised at the attention for a moment, then nods and makes a noise. "Mmf."

You decide to take that as an affirmative.

***

Nanami has your proposed route, your points of interest along the way, and a program to broadcast a Governance handshake with a simple message asking anyone who hears it to respond (and relay the response to you, unless you're offline.) The four of you head out into the night, and she heads off to patrol with Homura.

Kyouko is eager to get moving. She seems somewhat agitated.

"Is something wrong?" asks Ryouko.

Kyouko hesitates, then sighs. "Yeah. Sparkling-eyed rookies who don't know how to take things seriously."

Ryouko shakes her head. "Nanami can take things *very* seriously," she says. "She's definitely still, uh, still *sparkly* about everything, but … well, if you call her out on something, she actually responds, and thinks things through. Like, that talk about taking risks, for instance."

"Mmf," grunts Kyouko. "Yeah, and that was a good way to put it, too, I guess."

She thinks on it for a while, and then asks a question.

"Hey, Clarisse, what the heck are you doing hanging around with magical girls, anyway? Why are you out on this patrol?"

You consider what you can tell her without telling additional future secrets.

"I'm mostly here to look out for Ryouko, really," you explain. "It's my job."

"You're also a friend," says Ryouko, smiling.

"Yeah, but what kind of job is that?" Kyouko asks. "Like, who actually employs you?"

"Ah. The military," you say.

"Ahh," says Kyouko. "Right." She walks on a few more moments before continuing. "So, Ryouko is the officer, and you're… some sort of a batman."

"Yes, that's a very good way of putting it," you declare. "I am the batman."

Kyouko smirks.

"What?" you ask.

"Oh, nothing," says Kyouko. "I just thought of something really funny."

You're a little suspicious.

"Hey," says Ryouko. "I think I felt something. It's a little faint."

Kyouko pauses. "You're not wrong," she says.

***

Fifteen minutes later, you're in a poorly lit alley, strewn with garbage, infested with rats, in what is almost certainly a bad part of town, when Kyouko motions for you to stop, and quickly ducks behind a dumpster. The two of you follow.

*Trouble ahead,* she sends to Ryouko telepathically.

*What kind of trouble?* your girl asks.

*Nothing magical. Two guys hanging around looking shady. Drug deal or something,* Kyouko replies, businesslike, then shifts her tone to complain. \*Damn it. These are always annoying, because you can't always get to the witch without someone noticing you. Especially in a place like this.

Ah,\* says Ryouko.

You close your eyes and listen to the radio landscape ahead of you.

*Is there a way you can get to the other side of the alley?* you ask your girl. *If we can get a few meters between us I can do some electronic intelligence.*

Your girl acknowledges you internally. *Hold on,* she sends to Kyouko, *doing a thing with Clarisse*. In a moment she's found her way to a nook in the wall by some doors.

Perfect. You can trilaterate with this. You make a quick map. Most of the signals are stationary, which helps a lot. You concentrate on the third…

*There are two cell phones up ahead,* she tells Kyouko\*, one more approaching from the north, I think. Not moving too fast. The specifics are kinda fuzzy\*.

*… North?* asks Kyouko. \*Which way is north?!?

The alley joins up with a cross-street about 200 meters ahead of us,\* Ryouko replies. *Left. I think. We can probably teleport by after he's passed, or come to meet this guy.*

She peeks out from the nook to get a better look. One of the people ahead is lighting some sort of a cigarette, and you catch a glimpse of their faces.

Oof.

*Ryouko,* you tell your girl, \*I think that's Nanami's … brother, or stepbrother, or something.

Wait,\* she replies, *really?*

You share a still frame from the memory footage you have.

*Huh,* she thinks.

Kyouko is suddenly angry. \*Damn it! \*she cries. \*I don't think this is even a witch at all. Just a fat familiar. We've been wasting our time.

Oh,\* Ryouko replies. \*This isn't quite my specialty, so I'll defer to you here.

Wait,\* she says. *Hold on. It's a real fat familiar, right? So we probably just need to hang around a little longer, until these druggies stab one another or whatever, and it'll be a proper witch.*

You're pondering whether to say something about this when the moving contact becomes visible at the end of the alley. Ryouko's enhanced vision can just make him out in the halo of a streetlamp, and it appears that he's wearing a uniform, like some sort of a policeman.
