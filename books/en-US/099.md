# It feels like you're trying to replace me

**> Dance with me, Ophelia-chan**

Oh dear.

You're going to dance with her. While carrying inside your self an unshielded shard of magic from the most powerful magical girl to date, plus something like a dozen Simona shards in a bubble, plus the one Ophelia holding — in the presence of these, and the ribbon, you're going to recall Ophelia's role as a dancer, you're going to reprise that role, engaging her in an act of motion and emotion. In the name of hope. Goodness.

You must — Please, permit your dear narrator a moment. I must strengthen the wards.

***

Okay.

I'm afraid I have some bad news.

Clarisse, you can't dance.

Neither can Ophelia. She's always been disappointed that she could never get lessons. It's a dream of hers. She was going to make a wish about it, actually.

But there is something in your soul that is like a dance. It is your duet, so to speak, with Ryouko. You have lived inside her, fought aliens with her, shared hopes with her. There is a little of this in many lives, when the world-lines of souls come together and follow the same course for a while, sharing hopes, their lives changing one another, finding their way in the world together. Your dance with Ryouko in particular is quite close.

Mind you. That's not quite enough by itself. But Ophelia was very dancey in her other lives, and if she will let you, you can borrow from that past, and it will fill in the rest.

***

You approach the possessed girl careful carefully.

"Ophelia," you say, gently. "I understand. You think that you need to do something to make things better. You're not quite sure why, but it's the most important thing in the world. You'll do anything. You'll do... terrible things, that you don't really want to do."

"... Yes," she says. "Yes, I will. But... I don't want to."

She looks into your eyes, and seems sad.

You take her hand.

"But that's not how you truly feel," you continue, looking into her eyes. "Will you dance with me, Ophelia?"

It's not a grand dance, or a grand spectacle. It's just a simple little waltz with a gentle violin accompaniment. But moving together with her will let you reach out to the soul that she is carrying and speak to it. You can dance with Simona.

You have a lot in common with her, actually. You are both genetically engineered by the same conspiracy, you are both dedicated to Ryouko's well-being, and you are both in love with her. Because of this, because you understand, you can show her that you understand — and then, you can share your hope with her.

***

There's a flutter in your heart, because you are doing magic.

Oh, you've channeled magic before, sending someone else's soul somewhere to make something happen. Borrowing Ryouko's magic from memory to borrow magic from other people is fundamentally similar to borrowing Nanami's railgun. This is qualitatively different. Before, you were a mirror, but now you are the sun.

Okay, well, maybe not the sun. A small, distant star. Still. It's very exciting, and also scary.

Yes, scary. What if Kyuubey notices?

The dance ends, and you take the feather from Ophelia, and she is herself again, but she seems sad, somehow.

"Are you okay?" you ask.

"I'm sorry," says Ophelia. "For what I said to you earlier."

"You were under the influence of powerful magic," you tell her. "It's not your fault. If anything, you were remarkably restrained, given the circumstances."

She shakes her head.

"On the phone, " she says. "When I was tearing you down, mocking you. Maybe that wasn't all me, but I think that some of it was. It was... gratifying. And I think I need to face that, because... because that's not who I want to be. I'm sorry," she says.

"I forgive you," you tell her.

She nods, and smiles, but still seems to be a little bit ashamed.

The violinist — who appears to have a dorm room nearby — launches into another, more energetic piece, and it seems to break a bit of a spell that had been lingering.

"Right," you say. "I don't think we're quite done, but we probably shouldn't be caught back here, or there will be no end to the gossip. Will you text me when Simona wakes up?"

She nods.

At this moment, you are interrupted.

*Are you all right?* asks Machina.

Attached to the inquiry are several details that have given her concern. There's been a surge of magic from several locations, distressingly close to Homura, Kyouko, Nanami — and at your home. Moreover, she's spotted an anomaly in your signal; it's clearly a consequence it bouncing through a wormhole, but under other circumstances you might expect this sort of effect from a labyrinth or similar distortion.

\*I've actually returned to America on an important errand, \*you reply, sending a detail of the signal path as an explanation. *I should be back in a minute? I think just reversed Simona's despair. I mean, all the way.*

Nanami checks in next. \*The feathers have all turned white. I guess that's good?

I suppose that Kyuubey probably noticed, \*you note. \*But otherwise good, I think.

Well, if he didn't, *says Nanami,* every magical girl from here to Shanghai should be able to tell him about it.\*

You cringe internally.

*We'll deal with Kyuubey when he asks about it,* you say.

***

The wormhole-portal magic you've borrowed from Simona has a way to shrink the connection down to a minimal width, instead of closing it all the way, so it's less energy to re-open it.

Ryouko, it seems, has been woken by the magic, though her nap was coming to an end anyway.

"I dreamed that you were dancing with Simona," says Ryouko.

"That's... sort of what happened," you tell her, and explain.

She's not quite sure what to make of you doing magic. She can tell you're a little excited, but, well, there are other things on her mind. Her visit to the Star Empire is bothering her. Of note, it seems the other Clarisse took her on a tour of some rather strange experiment sites, and this affected her dreaming. The memory isn't as crisp as if it had been recorded, but she remembers the outlines of it quite well enough —

\*"Plant people," says the other Clarisse, introducing the greenhouse. "Hybridizing the reproductive cycle. They grow flowers in their hair and will reproduce via pollination and alternation of generations."

Ryouko stares down, strangely fascinated.

"Of course, the whole genetic purity thing is an empty farce," she continues. "As you are no doubt aware, the Princess is actually extensively engineered, though they keep it a secret. It only really matters insofar as Oriko and Yuma can control people with it, and stay in power. They'll actually be quite happy to discard the conceit once it no longer serves their needs, which is the reason we've actually been allowed to make any progress on the issue.*"*

She sighs, bitterly.

"But why would they make... these?" asks Ryouko.

"Grand social experiments?" the other Clarisse replies, with a shrug. "Who knows? Maybe some day, they'll build a version of humanity, loyal only to them, with even more magical girls than the original. Maybe they're simply meant as a backup, in case the rest of humanity actually turns on them. Maybe they're the only ones who survive a coming apocalypse."

The two walk along an elevated pathway above the greenhouse for a little while, as Ryouko looks down at the people below. They don't seem to notice her.

"It's also a creative outlet, of sorts," adds Clarisse. "Not for Oriko so much, but for Yuma, and some of her lieutenants."

"A creative outlet?" Ryouko enquires, skeptical of that framing.\*

*"What better way to play God, than to create life?" asks Clarisse.*

***

Ryouko feels... mostly confused by it all, and unsure how she is meant to react; her ultimate conclusion is that she'd really feel better if she could go kill something. The inconvenience of hunting detracts from this a little, but nevertheless she sets out with the other magical girls to hunt witches (or demons). Nanami has taken over the watch of Oriko, who remains under house arrest, more or less, while Yuma accompanies Mami and Kyouko watches Kirika. This leaves Ryouko with Homura. She soon finds a trail of a witch in an industrial district, and the group is trying to adapt some strategies from the Governance demon-hunting playbook to make its searches more efficient.

In the meantime, you are doing sleepover things with Hitomi, getting to know each other better, and finding things in common. Hitomi is slightly fascinated by suddenly having a sister, someone with about the same face. For you it's a little different; she does look an awful lot like Ryouko, and — well, it's not that you are confusing her with Ryouko as a person, it's just that she figures into your kinesthetic sense of self in a strange way. You sort of expect to be occupying the same volume of space that she is, and feeling the same physical sensations, as if she were Ryouko. You always had the first-person view of Ryouko, of course, but back home there were plenty of third-person, external views to tap into as well, and you frequently did so, and you're used to her as your avatar, the view of her from the outside matching, and understanding what she was doing, and why.

The upshot of this is that you are both remarkably entertained by — well, by simply looking at each other, watching each other, Hitomi making a game of trying to match your motions like she's a mirror, touching your fingertips, and other things like that. She has temporarily copied your hairstyle, and is distracted by looking for something — or a pair of somethings — to put on your head, when you notice a certain manga volume on one of her bookshelves.

You remove a volume to check.

"Hitomi?" you ask.

"Yes?" she replies.

"Did you buy these just recently?" you ask her.

You shouldn't jump to conclusions, but they look... very well-read. She probably wouldn't have bought them used to save money, but maybe the used copies of the volumes were easier for her to find? Content-publishing logistics in 2011 are certainly different than Governance.

"Oh, no," says Hitomi, confirming your suspicions. "That's been one of my favorites for a while now."

"Really," you reply.

At first glance, it could be any old pop idol romance manga, but the blurb on the back of the particular volume you've selected has a blurb proclaiming "Forbidden Love!!!" and there are definitely two girls kissing on the cover.

"It's just that earlier you left me earlier with the distinct impression that you were quite innocent and entirely unfamiliar with this sort of thing," you say, holding up the cover.

Hitomi giggles, and blushes a little.

"Oh, goodness me," she says. "I've been exposed!"

"Feigning innocence!" you exclaim. "It seems I've misjudged you, Hitomi."

"Well," she says, "I confess, I didn't quite know what to expect of you at the time, and I was a bit flustered. You might have teased, or gossiped, or told Papa."

"I see," you say.

"I do try to be conscious of the impression that I give people," says Hitomi, then she pauses. "Actually, that's related to why I asked you to do this," she tells you.

"Oh?" you ask, expectantly.

Hitomi sits down in front of you, and fiddles with her hair for a moment, returning it to its natural style, before continuing.

"Clarisse," she finally says, quite earnestly. "I want to talk about love again."

"... Okay," you say. "What about love?"

"I was thinking, earlier," says Hitomi. "There's love, and there's being in love, and they're not always the same, are they?"

"Oh, certainly not," you say.

"So I was thinking," she says, "about what people mean to me, and who means the most to me. And then you said something that made me realize that you can be in love with different people at the same time."

This is a little but worrisome.

"Were you thinking of having more than one relationship at the same time?" you ask — but she's already shaking her head No.

"No," she says. "It's not like that. I'm not going to go have lots of relationships at once. That might be a little too futuristic. It just that helped make me realize what was going on."

"When you're in love with someone," observes Hitomi, "you do things to make them happy, and you do things to make them like you. Right? Even when it's not something you might have done on your own, you want to be more special."

You nod. "I suppose that's often true."

"So I realized that the person I love the most," concludes Hitomi, "and the person I'm in love with the most … is Papa."

You blink in surprise.

"I know, I know," she says. "I know it won't ever work out as a romantic love, and that's okay. I'll find someone else, some day, and I'm sure that will make both of us very happy. But I think maybe I've gotten ahead of myself. Because I really do want to make Papa happy, just by myself, and to be someone very special for him."

"I'm positive you are quite special to him," you tell her.

She smiles.

"I know," she says. "And — you know, that's something I work at, too. Sometimes, when he comes back from a big trip, I'll change into a nice long dress, and wait for him at the top of the stairs, and then I'll float down the staircase as gracefully as I can and give him a hug. Even if it's a little bit calculated, and not as spontaneous as it looks, it's okay if it makes him happy, right?"

"I see," you say.

"And that makes it special to me, too," she adds, before getting a little more serious.

"But you know what?" she asks. "You and Ryouko are both special too. And you two are magic, and I'm not."

Ah. You understand now.

She's jealous.

"That's why I wanted to do the ballet lessons," continues Hitomi. "It's the one thing I can do that's even more special than magic. Especially to Papa."

It occurs to you that there is a reason why this specifically is the case, that things like these would be particularly special to him. It's the sort of thing he might have dreamed of for his life, a life never led... and of course she doesn't know about this at all...

"So I'm happy to take you to watch a lesson," says Hitomi. "I've already told Mama. But at the same time, I'm a little worried. Maybe it's irrational, and I'm just paranoid." She sighs. "But inside, it feels like you're trying to replace me."

She looks at you, expectantly awaiting your explanation.
