# you’re a pretty nebula

\[3] This is *not* Ryouko's fault.
-\[3] She did nothing to cause this. Simona created this yandere obsession entirely from her own mind, and Kyubey probably encouraged it for the sake of a contract.
-\[3] We'll try to get through to Simona and help her, but she is not *entitled* to have her crush reciprocated or to *have* Ryouko.

*We'll do everything we can to help,* you tell Ryouko, \*but it's no good if you think that it's all your fault. It's Simona's own fault. Possibly Kyuubey's too. He might even have encouraged it and at the very least, he's been an enabler. This is all on her, she's *not* entitled to you any more than Homura is entitled to Madoka. If she feels entitled to you, it can't possibly come to any good in the end for you or for her.

I know that,\* replies Ryouko, \*but remember what Madoka said? She said I need to be careful or I'm going to break someone's heart. I should have known better.

Well, you're a teenage girl,\* you tell Ryouko. \*Not knowing what you're doing is part of the package, and you're not expected to get everything right the first time. What you are supposed to do is to learn, and treat others with respect and care.

Yeah,\* she says, *well, a real good job I've done at learning so far; the Goddess herself has to call me out on it in person!* She sighs, externally.

*I hardly expect that's the reason that we're here,* you remark drily.

\*Clarisse, *w*hat's wrong with me? Why am I so stupid and oblivious?

Oh goodness, Ryouko,\* you try to reassure her. *You just don't think of yourself as an object of desire,* you tell her. *It's the way your psyche works, I guess. It doesn't make you bad or wrong. Remember, Clarisse von Rossum told you as much herself.*

Ryouko ponders this during the ride home.

\[3] Head home first

This seems to be what Papa and Mr. Shindou expected anyway. You keep mostly quiet while Papa's lawyer deals with things, attending to other tasks during the drive.

\[6] Try to let Kyouko and Mami meet up and have a moment to reconnect before the group meeting
\[3] Confer with Machina about the feasibility of telling Mami about witches.

You share your plans for an outing this afternoon with Machina.

*It's something that I think we have to tell her about sooner or later,* you say to Machina. *It's the sort of thing a magical girl in this universe deserves to know, and I don't intend to keep it a secret from the others. Better to do it under controlled circumstances.*

Machina sighs, electronically. \*You're right, but I'm not sure how well she'll take it.

What could we do to mitigate it?\* you ask.

\*Well, you're right; beginning by telling her that the future isn't like that should help, at least to start. But unless you have a more concrete idea about what's happening with grief seeds here, I'm not sure how long that's going to last. And if Oriko has some sort of a plan for it and we don't, well, I don't quite know what she'll make of that. She'll be driven to distraction, at the very least.

I agree,\* you affirm,\* we definitely need a plan there.

Besides that…\* Machina pauses.\* Well… she's very lonely. She doesn't really have friends. When she's not hunting witches she's busy trying to be a good student, which is really hard for her.

Oh, Machina,\* you say, sending her an electronic hug.

\*What — I'm not that lonely! \*she objects. \*I've been reaching out and making friends, whenever I've had the time.

And how often is that?\* you ask.

*… Sometimes!* replies Machina, unconvincingly.

*Well, dear, you are at grave risk of isolation here in the twenty-first century,* you say, \*and you are going to have an awful lot of time on your hands.

Okay, okay, I get it,\* she says. \*And hey, Clarisse?

Yes?\* you reply.

\*Remember to look after yourself, too. For Ryouko's sake, if nothing else.

I will,\* you promise. \*Just let me know when they come by to send Mami home. Or if they don't.

Tut tut,\* she says. \*You just leave Mami to me and worry about Ryouko.

For the meeting later, I mean!

Okay, okay,\* she says. *I'll let you know.*

**\[5] Make sure to sanitize the nomenclator of future knowledge about current-people.**

You send around a quick data update, which people install promptly enough, with the exception of Nanami, who spends a few seconds before installing it, then sends you back a message.

*Probably a good idea*, she notes.

It's just as well that she noticed; she's basically far too deep into the rabbit-hole already for hiding such things to make a difference at this point.

\[5] Reassure Nanami by talking about future meddling with her wish

\<Clarisse> hey Nanami! while I have your attention!
\<Clarisse> combination good news / worrisome news
\<Nanami> Ohhh really?
\<Clarisse> You know how you were asking if you'd gone and ruined everything with your wish?
\<Clarisse> I believe we can now say that this is not the case!
\<Nanami> … you do realize even if some individual thing exists that *isn't* ruined, the overall sentiment remains ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")
\<Clarisse> well, more specifically.
\<Clarisse> I've heard testimony, ostensibly from the future, that someone meddled with your wish.
\<Nanami> … okay (a) where are you getting Testimony from the future??!?
\<Nanami> … (b) they can DO that?!?! how?!?
\<Clarisse> i'm much less sure about (b), but as for (a), it appears that our friend Simona opened some sort of time window\*,\* and I talked to future!Clarisse (or at least she *looked* like me, anyway).
\<Clarisse> aaaand then Simona threw a fit about Ryouko's girlfriend and cut off part of the end
\<Nanami> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
\<Clarisse> Yes, that part was \*particularly \*heartening, and, broadly speaking, there's more to it I don't understand. The good news is we have some information on how to save our future? We should talk more later.
\<Clarisse> Right now I need to figure out how to handle Simona with Ryouko.
\<Clarisse> But I thought that I should let you know, so that you could worry less.
\<Nanami> Clarisse, darling, time windows from the future *do not* help me to worry *less*
\<Clarisse> Help you worry less about your wish. It's *specifically unhealthy* for magical girls and impacts your magic.
\<Nanami> Ah, I see. Then … thanks.
\<Nanami> Thanks a bunch. ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")
\<Nanami> I'll try to take care of myself ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")
\<Clarisse> You and me both ![:)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Smile    :)")

\[5] Warn Yuuka that her father might be at risk of losing his job.

Oh, you are not looking forward to this…

Okay, on second thought? Maybe you should wait. You definitely definitely need to let her know, but, it didn't sound like he was about to be fired in the next *two hours*, did it? And if you can just wait a little bit, she'll have friends around, too. If friends can help Mami they'd be good for her, too.

Anyway, you're almost back home. You'll do it when you get together with everyone later, then. It shouldn't be long.

***

Papa is going to have a little chat with Mr. Shindou and then head into work, but he wants to tell all three of you how much he loves you, first, in case he doesn't catch you on the way out. It appears that there is an affirmative Hug involved with telling you this. Hitomi appears to be well practiced with this, standing up on the porch-step to get just a little bit of a boost.

"Now remember, Clarisse," says Hitomi, as the three of you enter the house again, "take a moment to breathe."

"Right," you say. You can ill afford another confrontation with Kyuubey. And you promised Machina, too.

***

"Clarisse?" asks Ryouko.

You've just crashed backwards onto the bed, and you're trying to definitely *not* think of why you might be possessed of glowing, golden eyes at some point in your future.

"Yes?" you ask, welcoming the distraction.

"Why do people even like me?"

"What??" you reply, sitting back up. "Why *wouldn't* people like you?"

"You said part of the reason I don't understand is the way I view myself," she says, "and the more I think about it, the more I'm just a stupid teenage girl." She sighs. "I'm even not, like, pretty or anything. I wouldn't be anyone interesting or special, except for the magic, and that's hardly even fair, and doesn't explain Simona wanting to confess to me earlier, either. So I don't get it."

You are, for a moment, speechless.

"I'm not even sure where to best begin with that," you tell her, aghast. "I mean … For starters, really, just being a teenage girl is plenty special in and of itself, *especially* to your peers. And where in known space did you get the idea that you're not pretty?"

"I thought I was just … small, and cute, or something," she says, looking over to the mirror. "Not, like, lovely, or beautiful, or cool, or… anything like the things people like at all."

"Oh goddess, Ryouko," you sigh, and bury your face in your hands, "you're *definitely* small and cute, but you're those other things too."

"I am??" she asks, confused. "How?"

"Being small and cute doesn't mean you don't have a beautiful face, or lovely long hair, or a cool attitude. It just makes all those things more approachable."

"Cool attitude?" asks Ryouko, very confused.

"Yes, well, you and I both know that you're a space nerd and a giant dork, daydreaming all the time. And it turns out that a large part of looking cool is the attitude of slight disinterest — not contempt, just, the feeling that you have somewhere better to be. In your case, it's just space."

"I thought that just made me different and weird…" she says.

\*"\*It's good different," you tell her. "It makes you more interesting. *Otherworldly*," you propose. "Everything works together quite nicely, and in summary, you are a lovely being."

"But… but…" she stutters, as she gives the mirror a long hard look, dissatisfied. "My breasts are, like, *really* small!"

\*"\*Oh goddess, Ryouko," you exclaim, "that is NOT the only thing that matters!!!"

"It's not?" she asks.

In fairness, you know that she doesn't *mean* it's the only thing that matters, she just means that it's an important thing that really seems to matter to a lot of people. But still, the phrasing of the objection isn't good.

*"OF COURSE NOT.*" you exclaim in mild exasperation. "Were you asleep, when they covered these things in Mandatory Sess— oh, well, no, of course you weren't. You were just daydreaming about *nebulae*."

"Yeah, well," says Ryouko, "nebulae are really pretty."

"Fine, then," you declare, "you're a *pretty nebula*."

"… oh, Clarisse," says Ryouko, taken aback. "That's the … single most romantic thing I've ever heard." Her heart is just a little bit aflutter. "A nebula. I'd have to have ionized oxygen, of course, for the spectral emissions…"

It occurs to you that it's theoretically possible you might have been able to predict this reaction.

"… perhaps I should have saved that line for Asami," you say.

"Oh — oh," exclaims Ryouko, "if Asami is the gravitational force, then that means that she and I together …" she pauses, and whispers. "she makes me a star."

Her eyes twinkle, and she beams, and she feels like the most special girl in the universe. It is so cute that it physically hurts, which confuses you a moment. Why should it hurt — oh, no, that's where they get the phrase, isn't it? It pulls on your heart-strings.

You smile, though.

"Well then," you say, "it's settled. The first reason that everyone falls in love with Ryouko is because she's as pretty as a nebula."

"Yes, and I'm working on noticing," she reiterates. "I'm just not sure how to start thinking of myself as having that effect on people. Like, which people, even? When did it start? Is Simona just the first to notice?"

"I'm not even sure if she is," you tell her. "Chiaki may or may not have had a thing for you, too."

"Chiaki?!?" asks Ryouko, shocked.

"It could go either way," you tell her. "But yes, *everyone* is a candidate."

"*Everyone* everyone?" she continues. "Even Papa?"

The tug on your heart-strings is joined by that special feeling.

"Oh, *especially* Papa," you say, "he's really quite taken with both of us, and Hitomi too. Not romantically, mind you. He channels it differently. It's illustrative; *romantic* attraction is of course likeliest among your peers, but other people might just want to help you out, or to be more like you, or to be special to you somehow, *especially* as you become more of a hero. And, of course, there will be some who just want take you to bed for the night."

Ryouko is working ever so hard at the idea of herself being a center of attention like that, and thinking back to the things you said earlier about celebrity, as well. Her feelings are decidedly mixed.

"It still feels unfair, though," she says. "Wouldn't it be better if I did more to earn it?"

"Saving the world isn't enough?" you ask.

"No," she insists. "That was as much the goddess just *using* me as anything else."

"You sort of agreed to help her, though," you point out. "And quite honestly, it's not a position that's likely to leave you unaffected in the long term. Have you thought what it might mean to be her agent?"

"… Not really," she admits. "I can't really just say *no*, though, can I? With everything at stake?"

"Perhaps not," you allow, "but I *have* thought about it, and I'd be lying if I said that I was entirely happy with the idea." You sigh. "Especially after what Madoka said while holding the ribbon."

"… Oh," says Ryouko. "But… it's still important."

You nod. "Yes, it is. Which is why it's very scary."

You just really want your girl to live a long and happy life. It's not that much to ask, is it, really?

The moment's quiet is interrupted by Papa calling from downstairs. "Ryouko?"

"Yes?" she says, getting up and heading to the door.

"I seem to have something for you down here," he says.

***

A few moments later, Ryouko is back, bearing an envelope from some overnight mail service. Someone had addressed it to his office, but with Shizuki Ryouko as the recipient, and it arrive this morning and Mr. Shindou left it with Papa. Your girl has put it down on the desk in your room, and is staring at it. There's a big bar code shipping label, printed on plain paper and attached to the envelope with clear tape, but the hand-written return address, in an orange gel pen on the white envelope, states the sender clearly:

Simona
Salem Academy Box 2460
61S Church St
27109, USA

The dot over the 'i' is replaced with a small and subtle but clearly deliberate heart shape.

"Now why would the law office have it?" you wonder. "Maybe that's the address on file with the school?"

Ryouko is very nervous about this.

"Are you sure we should even open it?" she asks. "What if it's a trap?"

"A trap?" you ask. "Like, with some sort of magical enchantment inside?"

"No, I mean… psychological warfare."

She regards the envelope with suspicion, flicking it away from her across the surface in your direction.
