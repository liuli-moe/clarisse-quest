# if aliens have magical girls, they might be like Clarisse.

\> Ask Yuma to heal Ryouko's arm
\> Explain to Kirika the whole point of having lots of cubes distributed is to make freak events where people lose all their cubes not as big of an issue. Also, doing it later will cost more cubes and cause an investigation why Ryouko's arm is missing.

Getting Yuma to heal Ryouko is very easy. It's not that Yuma likes healing itself. It's that she *doesn't* like seeing broken things like this. In the Governance timeline, for instance, there was that dismembered gangster… So convincing her to ignore Kirika and help is no great effort.

Kirika grouses a bit but doesn't have a concrete plan about what else to do or what to do about you.

**> Everyone present except Yuma and Ryouko pursue the magical girl**

Yes. And you can help teleport people there, and contribute to monitoring the situation via radio.
(Also, you're just the slightest bit jealous of Kyouko looking at Sakura like she's you.)

It is easy enough to return to being standalone Clarisse, but there's something different. You can see it through Ryouko's eyes. You've lost the pink in your hair somehow. There's some small presence in your mind that's gone. Also, Ryouko has a pair of small fluffy wings.

This is to be expected, Clarisse; you're pouring yourself into a container that would be slightly overfull. You have a little bit of momentum, and there's more of you than there is of her, so it pushes her out.

"Hold on," you tell Ryouko. "I can fix this… I think."

***

Here are the things you have learned from trying to fix this.

The first is that jumping between bodies is an effort that leaves you a little tired. You really should rest a little while between jumps. The second is that the lighter soul is pushed out of the way by the jumps. The third is that Sakura is simply not compatible with Ryouko. She separates out from Ryouko, taking the form of fluffy white wings, but the soul-part is immiscible. She does not speak in Ryouko's mind, nor does she suddenly become a tactical computer.

The obvious solution would be if Ryouko could jump to you and you to her, so the fourth thing you learn is that you can't jump to Ryouko, or vice versa. Actually, it leaves her rattled, and more aware of her soul gem than usual. It feels to her like she bumped up against the bars of a cage.

The last thing is that even when you're just looking at souls with Princess Ryouko's magic, Sakura is *involved*, elevating that specific capability from a memory to something you can actually do. The source of that magic is physically separated from you now, and you're pretty sure that you'd lose it if you were too far away from her — even the ability to teleport, which is kind of the one you were hoping would make you a little more tactically useful. There's an alternate pathway to it through the ribbon, but it requires Ryouko's presence.

You can still teleport the others into position, though, and help everyone track the radio signals. Hopefully Ryouko will be back in action soon.

Mami is an urban warfare expert, and even more so with Machina assisting. She knows this city like the back of her hand, and tracks your quarry relentlessly through the concrete-lined underground stream.

Before long, Ryouko is in one piece again. Yuma, however, is insistent that she will be going with Ryouko now. She hates being left behind, and says that Ryouko has to do this for her as payback for her help. Also, she volunteers that green magical girls need to stick together. Ryouko seems willing enough to pay back the favor. You suppose this is okay; you had only really anticipated Yuma staying behind for long enough to help Ryouko.

The great greenway through Mitakihara is part of the city's flood control system as well. This means there is infrastructure running alongside the stream, overflow tunnels, with gates and weirs and storm sewer discharge points. Machina shares what she's found of the layout and some fragments from Mami's prior attempts to gain access to them for hunting witches.

While your target has so far favored a straight shot through the main channel, it will be tricky to corner someone down there.

Your target is soon laying low again, so you are playing a bit of a waiting game. You have made your way into what seems to be the local flood control center, providing you with a vantage point for radiolocation; you are also investigating whether you can make use of the closed circuit feeds to catch the splashes of anyone running in the water. Mami is setting up webs of ribbons, as you try to flush her out. Out of an abundance of caution you also send a warning to Sayaka to be on her guard, as her apartment is not too far away, and you are wary of her being targeted.

A few moments later, Ryouko's soul gem starts glowing.

*Why is it doing that now?* Ryouko asks.

There is a very short list of times that Ryouko's has glowed in the past. All of them have something in common.

Indeed, Machina wishes to know urgently if there are any times when this doesn't signify Ceph drives or stealth technology.

*It feels somewhat different,* Ryouko indicates, and takes a moment to figure out why.

It's not the feeling itself that's different, it's coming from somewhere else somehow, she realizes suddenly.

\*Clarisse! \*she relays. *It's near you!*

As you process this thought, but before you can react, an object flies through the crack under the door. It is a small, rectangular thing, glowing brightly. You catch a glimpse of markings, but not a good one.

This strikes you as an excellent moment to evacuate. You reach for the appropriate magic —

The bright object detonates, with surprisingly little force, just a slight puff of wind, but a shimmery light covers everything in sight, coating it like a luminescent dust. It fades quickly.

But now you find you can't teleport out. This little device has disrupted the attempt somehow, you're sure of it; there is a resistance when you make the attempt.

The door opens. Because you know exactly where to look you can make out the outline of distortion, a faint radio emission, and hear the imperfectly silenced sound of a stealth device doing its best to hide someone.

*Ryouko?* you call to her, sending your thought of *help me, please.*

Ryouko cannot jump to where you are. It's an effect on the local space, you think.

This leaves you facing an unknown entity with unknown powers, all alone.

You brace yourself for a fight, reach for an offensive power. If the teleport won't work maybe the railgun. Or would a spear be better in such close quarters? Yes, and surely Kyouko would be willing. You will do so —

The cloaked figure just avoids you, opening an exit door to the outside, dashing off into the distance.

You provide a vector to Ryouko. \*I'm safe. Never mind me. Follow it, \*you instruct.

***

The chase continues, but Ryouko is without teleports for a short while, and in the open areas here it is much harder to find your target. She is able to follow the interloper, but the team loses your target about the same time as the teleport effect fades.

Out of an abundance of caution, you have Ryouko check in on Sayaka, but the only outcome of this is Sayaka asking for Ryouko to get off her balcony before her mother notices.

Kirika has decided to return to Oriko's, annoyed, and takes a slightly disappointed Yuma with her, while the rest of you sit in a circle and teleconference with Nanami for the debrief. Ryouko is relaying to Homura again. She seems to like it, actually, and wonders a little whether a duty like this is a little bit of what it means to be Clarisse — which it is, a little.

"It's human sized," says Ryouko. "Stealthed, but we've faced better stealth. Armed with something we haven't figured out yet, which disrupts teleports; obviously that's trouble."

"Technological or magical?" asks Nanami.

"The disruption seemed to involve magic," continues Ryouko. "The stealth seemed technological, but more like alien technology than human. My soul gem reacted."

"Maybe that was a reaction to the magic," you propose. "You've reacted to spatial disruption before, at the wormhole mission…"

She shakes her head. "But there was a stealthed alien fleet there, too," she says.

"Are you suggesting it's alien, then?" you ask.

"I'm not entirely sure," she says. "But I think we should be open to the possibility."

"It's a much simpler explanation if it's just magic," you note. "Because then it's just Kyuubey sending people after us with more counters to take us down. If it's some magical girl who's obtained alien technology, well, I have a candidate, and her name is Simona, so I can't rule it out, but it doesn't feel quite right."

"What if it's an alien with magic?" proposes Wakaba on the teleconference.

"That would be shockingly unprecedented," you say. "No one has ever met an alien magical girl."

"The device we have doesn't look like ceph tech," says Ryouko. "And it is unlike Kyuubey's other tools."

She picks it up for a better look —

Suddenly there is a flash of light and a startling zap, and she lets it go, in alarm.

The card has changed. It now has a pink color with a magic circle on one side, featuring an icon of the Moon, a small star contained in a sub-circle, and the feather. The other side has a picture of a girl you've seen before in mirrors, and a label. "Zettai zettai daijobou."

Also, Ryouko's fluffy wings have vanished.

"Okay. It's a passive container for soul magic," you say. "Lovely."

The idea itself is harmless. Actually, you've used one already. It's on your head right now. What you're a little unnerved at is the idea of others having access to this magic, and what they might do to souls, splitting them up.

The others take a moment to look at it.

"This sort of thing might let someone do magic," you note, "without being a magical girl herself."

"Oh," says Homura. "It's like the charms. But… it seems better done."

You consider the implications of this.

"If someone is making charms that are actually magic," you propose, "it could be secondhand magic, from witches or familiars. That doesn't seem like the highest quality magic to me. Or maybe there's just more of the magic, and it has a self-organizing effect."

"Mami-chan would have noticed that," says Mami.

"Whatever it was loaded with is probably not as much magic," you note. "Of course this still isn't something you see in our future…"

"So if aliens have magical girls," proposes Wakaba, "they might be like Clarisse."

"Me?" You are a little surprised. "I don't think that I count as a real magical girl…"

You explain how you are simply using a shard of a soul from the nearly-forgotten past to wield the magic power of a princess from an erased future so that you can wield the power of friendship. In conclusion, Wakaba thinks that your objection is very silly.

Indeed, Clarisse, you are being silly. I blame the Governance-Incubator propaganda. If there is any doubt, there was that time you danced.

"So you developed your own magic after being very close to Ryouko's magic and borrowing powers," says Wakaba, still under the impression that this is pretty normal.

"Yes, but this just isn't the way it works!"

"Oh fuck," says Nanami. "The Incubators. The grief cubes and the witches aren't just about collecting energy, they help to make sure that no one can have access to an alternative model for magical girls, and challenge their monopoly."

You realize something. You... probably shouldn't tell them all about it, because, well, the matter of Nadeshiko is a little delicate yet, but it should be okay to summarize.

"Something like this actually might have happened before," you say, hesitantly. "I heard a story about another girl like that who started to learn magic without a contract. She wasn't even very magical, but… not too long after that all the witches in town suddenly disappeared, and her friends ran out of grief seeds, and everyone turned on each other."

"When was this?" asks Kyouko. "I've never heard of anything like it.

"Um. A few decades ago," you say.

"Where do you go to hear these things?" wonders Kyouko.

"Fuck," says Nanami.

"What?" asks Wakaba.

"We're next, that's what," says Nanami. "We're down to about twenty-five cubes, and a dozen grief seeds, and by Homura's account, there's a gigantic disaster witch heading this way in like a month."

"And maybe aliens," notes Wakaba.

"We haven't begun to establish a possible reason for aliens to be right here right now," says Ryouko.

"That incident earlier today," says Nanami. "With the feathers. It's a hell of a beacon. Think there's any way they could detect that?"

"… Maybe," you allow. "If the magic is superluminal … and if they just happened to have a scout somewhere nearby to divert on short notice…" You consider. "There might be some nonlinear causation at work, too; the witch's magic could be powerful enough that it works by creating an abstract occasion for disaster, rather than causing it directly. Then that catastrophe could be filled just as well by an alien invasion as a storm or tsunami."

"So … um … what do we do?" asks Homura, concerned.

"Let's not get ahead of ourselves," you say. "This is all still highly speculative."

"We need grief cubes," says Nanami.

\> How well spread are the demons at the moment?

Machina fields this question. "We haven't seen a standalone miasma yet," she relates, "but from my extrapolation of grief models to a zero-demon configuration, it's not too surprising, even with a generous boost from witches. We should start seeing them soon, though, and at normal rates midweek to Friday."
